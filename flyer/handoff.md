# Handoff: Wednesday Campaign Recruitment

The goal is to create a new flyer and update the website to recruit two players for the Wednesday night "Odyssey of the Dragonlords" D&D campaign.

## Plan

1.  **Rename existing flyer:** Rename `flyer/flyer.tex` to something like `monday_campaign_flyer.tex` to avoid confusion with the new flyer. The user has suggested `lost_mine_of_the_drow_flyer.tex`.

2.  **Create new flyer:** A file `flyer/oodl_flyer.tex` already exists. It needs to be updated with the specific details for the "Odyssey of the Dragonlords" campaign. We will need to get the following information from the user:
    *   The Pitch
    *   The Vibe
    *   Who We're Looking For (now for 2 players)
    *   Your Character
    *   The Details (Day is Wednesday, need to confirm time and location)
    *   Any changes to the QR codes.

3.  **Update Website:** After the flyer content is decided, update `site_src/wednesday/index.md` with a recruitment section similar to the Monday campaign page. This section will include the game details and the user's email for applications.

## Next Steps

1.  Rename `flyer.tex`.
2.  Get the content for the new `oodl_flyer.tex` from the user.
3.  Update `oodl_flyer.tex`.
4.  Update `site_src/wednesday/index.md`.
