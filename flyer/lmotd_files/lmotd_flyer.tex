\subsection*{\textbf{The Pitch}}
What if you were the other side of the story? Join a drow noble house on a desperate mission. This campaign runs parallel to "Lost Mine of Phandelver," but from the villain's point of view.

\subsection*{\textbf{The Vibe}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A balance of combat, exploration, and roleplay.
    \item Morally complex characters with personal stakes.
    \item Family loyalty, politics, and difficult choices.
    \item Playing characters who aren't traditional heroes but have believable motivations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\textbf{Who We're Looking For}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reliable players (21+) for a character-driven story.
    \item We want someone excited by moral complexity and political intrigue.
    \item A team player who enjoys collaborative storytelling.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\textbf{Your Character}}
Your character will be an integral part of House T’alzar’s fight for survival. We prioritize a compelling character concept over any specific role or class—all are welcome.

\subsection*{\textbf{The Details}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{When}: Mondays, 6:30-10:30 PM
    \item \textbf{Where}: Old Northeast St. Pete
    \item \textbf{Vibe}: Established, casual group. We share food/drinks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\textbf{To Apply}}
\textcolor{DragonRed}{\textbf{st.pete.dnd@outlook.com}}. We're looking for a player who is ready to get into character and can join us every Monday night.
