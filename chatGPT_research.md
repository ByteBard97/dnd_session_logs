Understood. I’ll research how to configure MkDocs Material with the awesome-pages plugin so that folders like 'recaps/' and 'logs/'—each containing multiple markdown files—appear as collapsible sections in the sidebar, using current plugin and theme versions. I’ll include the correct `.pages` file syntax and `mkdocs.yml` configuration examples, and explain why collapsing might not work in certain setups.

I’ll let you know as soon as I have the findings ready.


# Collapsible Folder Sections in MkDocs Navigation

## Understanding the Issue with `.pages` and `collapse: true`

The **`collapse: true` setting in a `.pages` file only applies to directories containing a single page** – it collapses that one-page folder so only the page appears in nav (hiding the folder). In your case, **each folder (`recaps/`, `logs/`) has multiple Markdown files**, so `collapse: true` has no effect for grouping them. This is why all files are listed individually in the sidebar instead of under a collapsible section. The Awesome Pages plugin documentation confirms that `collapse: true` is meant for *single-page directories*, not for multi-page sections.

## Grouping Multiple Pages into Collapsible Sections (MkDocs + Awesome Pages v2)

To make a folder with multiple files appear as a collapsible section in the Material theme sidebar, you should **treat the folder as a navigation section** (without using `collapse: true`). Here’s how:

* **Ensure the plugin is enabled:** In your `mkdocs.yml`, you should have the Awesome Pages plugin listed. For example:

  ```yaml
  plugins:
    - search
    - awesome-pages
  ```

  This plugin allows you to control navigation per folder via `.pages` files.

* **Use the folder as a section:** By default, if you **omit the `nav` in** `mkdocs.yml`, MkDocs (with Awesome Pages) will include all folders as sections in the nav. A directory containing multiple pages will automatically appear as a grouped section (collapsible in the Material theme). To customize it, add a `.pages` file in the folder to set a nicer title or order.

* **Remove or avoid `collapse: true` in multi-page folders:** Since `collapse: true` is only for single-page directories, it should be removed in `recaps/.pages` and `logs/.pages` (it isn’t doing what you expect). Instead, use a `title` to label the section, and optionally define the order of pages:

  **`docs/recaps/.pages`:**

  ```yaml
  title: Recaps        # This will name the section "Recaps" in the nav:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
  nav:
    - recap_session_1.md
    - recap_session_2.md
    # ... list other files in the desired order
  ```

  **`docs/logs/.pages`:**

  ```yaml
  title: Logs          # Section name for "Logs"
  nav:
    - log_session_1.md
    - log_session_2.md
    # ... other log files in order
  ```

  The `title` field sets a custom display name for the folder in navigation. The `nav` list within `.pages` is optional – it lets you specify the exact order or grouping of items in that folder. If you omit `nav` in the `.pages` file, the plugin will include all files in default order (usually alphabetical, or natural sort if configured). You can also use sorting options like `sort_type: natural` if your file names include numbers (to ensure numeric order) – in version 2, you’d set `sort_type: natural` in the `.pages` file (note that in version 3, natural sorting is default).

* **Result:** With the above setup, the **sidebar navigation will show "Recaps" and "Logs" as collapsible sections**. Each section can be expanded to reveal the session pages inside. In Material for MkDocs, any directory with multiple pages will appear as a collapsible menu by default (indicated by an arrow icon) as long as you haven’t overridden this behavior. The navigation will **not list every file at the top level**, but rather group them under their folder. (If you currently see all files flat in the nav, it suggests the folders weren’t recognized as sections – the changes above will fix that by naming those folders as sections.)

* **Verify theme behavior:** Make sure you have not enabled the `navigation.expand` feature flag in Material, which auto-expands all sections. You likely want it off (default) so that sections stay collapsed until clicked. For reference, when `navigation.expand` is enabled, the sidebar *“will expand all collapsible subsections by default”*. Keeping it disabled means Recaps/Logs will start collapsed (except the section of the current page, which Material expands by design).

## Using the Latest **Awesome Nav** Plugin (v3.x)

*(The Awesome Pages plugin has been updated and renamed in recent versions.)*

As of 2025, \*\*mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin was renamed to **“**mkdocs-awesome-nav**”** (version 3+). The new version generates the nav entirely on its own and uses a slightly different file naming and options:

* **`.nav.yml` instead of `.pages`:** In v3, the default navigation config file in each folder is named `.nav.yml` (you can configure the name, but `.nav.yml` is the new default). You should rename your `.pages` files to `.nav.yml` when using *awesome-nav*. The content structure (title, nav list, etc.) remains similar.

* **Flattening single-page sections:** The old `collapse_single_pages` option is now called `flatten_single_child_sections`, and the `collapse: true` per-folder setting was **removed** in v3. This means you no longer use `collapse: true` at all – instead, if you want to hide a folder that has a single page, you’d use the flatten option (usually globally or via `.nav.yml`). In short, *awesome-nav* by default will show folders as sections, and you can choose to flatten single-page sections if desired (but again, your folders have multiple pages, so this isn’t needed).

* **Configuring titles and order:** In the new plugin, you still use the `title` field to set a section’s name and a `nav` list to order items. The syntax inside `docs/recaps/.nav.yml` would be the same as the earlier `.pages` example:

  ```yaml
  title: Recaps
  nav:
    - recap_session_1.md
    - recap_session_2.md
    - ... 
  ```

  and similarly for `logs/.nav.yml`. This achieves the same grouping in the nav. (Note: In v3, if you had a `nav` defined in **mkdocs.yml**, the plugin will **ignore it**. It expects you to define structure via the file system and `.nav.yml` files, or use a root `docs/.nav.yml` for global nav configuration. So ensure you’ve moved any manual nav config into the plugin’s system if upgrading.)

* **Plugin installation:** Update your `mkdocs.yml` to use the new plugin name:

  ```yaml
  plugins:
    - search
    - awesome-nav  # (instead of awesome-pages)
  ```

  All other Material theme features (like collapsible sections) work the same with the new plugin.

## Putting It All Together

After implementing the above changes, your sidebar navigation will treat **each subfolder as a collapsible group** containing its pages. For example, you will see a **“Recaps” section** with a dropdown arrow; clicking it will expand to show `recap_session_1`, `recap_session_2`, etc., and similarly for **“Logs”**. This behavior is the default for Material theme when the site navigation reflects the directory structure. By giving each folder a `title` (via `.pages` or `.nav.yml`), you ensure the section has a human-readable name in the nav (you can also rely on the folder name by default, but adding a title allows spacing or capitalization as needed).

Finally, double-check that your MkDocs and plugin versions are up-to-date and compatible. The **current MkDocs Material (9.x)** supports collapsible sections out of the box, and with **awesome-pages v2 or awesome-nav v3** the configuration above will work going forward. In summary:

* **Do not use** `collapse: true` for multi-page folders – it’s not meant for that (and is removed in newer versions).
* **Use `.pages`/`.nav.yml` files with `title`** to create named collapsible sections for each folder, and list the pages if a specific order is needed.
* **Keep the default behavior** (don’t force-expand all nav) so that these sections remain collapsible in the sidebar.

By following this approach with the latest MkDocs Material and Awesome Pages/Nav plugin, your **“Recaps” and “Logs” folders will appear as collapsible groups** in the sidebar navigation, rather than showing every file at once. This provides the cleaner, grouped navigation you expect.
