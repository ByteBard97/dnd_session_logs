<h3 id="session-29-recap-blood-on-the-black-oak"><strong>Session 29 Recap: Blood on the Black Oak</strong></h3>
<p>Your adventure continued as you finally stood before the Dead Falls. After navigating a treacherous, flooded passage, you emerged into a silent, hidden lake where the legendary ghost ship, the <strong><em>Ultros</em></strong>, awaited. Upon boarding the eerily pristine vessel, Kain touched the central mast and was struck by a vision of the dryad Delphia, whose spirit was bound to the wood when her tree was felled to create it. This act awakened the ship, and you were confronted by its spectral crew and its fearsome captain, <strong>Estor Arkelander</strong>.</p>
<p>After a tense dialogue where Estor revealed his pact with the "Lady of Dreams" (Lutheria) and tasked you with hunting his three "traitorous" thanes, you proceeded to the captain's cabin. There, you met the first thane, the ghost of <strong>Skaethon</strong>. He warned you that Estor’s offer was a trap to possess the strongest among you. Ignoring the warning, Kain initiated combat, and a brutal battle ensued in the cramped quarters.</p>
<p>The fight was desperate. Skaethon animated his armor and sword, locked the door to divide you, and proved a formidable foe. [cite_start]During the melee, Andrew Lynx unleashed the power of the <strong>Scepter of King Driptongue</strong>[cite: 1], using its <strong>Dark Resonance</strong> ability to infuse the party with necrotic power. This allowed you to make vampiric bite attacks, your eyes glowing black as you drained life from your enemies. Though Skaethon himself was immune to the necrotic drain, Zephyrion bit the animated sword in half, and Tharok bit a specter to death. After both Zephyrion and Tharok were knocked unconscious, Andrew Lynx dealt the final, decisive blow, destroying Skaethon with a barrage of Eldritch Blasts.</p>
<p><strong>Aftermath and Discoveries:</strong></p>
<p>With Skaethon vanquished, the remaining specters returned to their duties. In the now-quiet cabin, you found:
* <strong>Skaethon's Legacy</strong>: His magical suit of sea-motif armor, <strong>Azurescale</strong>, and his dark sword, <strong>Ebony</strong>, which is now damaged with a distinct bite mark in the blade.
* <strong>Treasure</strong>: A chest containing 300 gp, 50 pp, a black pearl, four bloodstones, an ivory siren statue, a silver dragon comb, and three powerful potions: <strong>Felix Felicis (Liquid Luck)</strong>, a <strong>Potion of Etherealness</strong>, and <strong>Sandman's Embrace</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Forward:</strong></p>
<p>One thane is down, but two remain. Estor Arkelander sits upon his throne on the upper deck, reading a tome titled <strong>"The Ledger of Wills,"</strong> awaiting the outcome of his challenge. You now have confirmation that his offer is a trap for possession. Meanwhile, Rhy-At holds a water-logged journal from a fallen adventurer, its secrets yet unread, and Zephyrion has befriended a mysterious, ghostly gray owl that watches from the rigging. You must now decide how to proceed with Estor's deadly game to claim the <em>Ultros</em>.</p>
<p><strong>07/02/2025</strong></p>
<h1 id="session-28-recap-whispers-of-the-dead-falls">Session 28 Recap: Whispers of the Dead Falls</h1>
<p>Your last session began in the thrumming heat of the Mithral Forge. Armed with newly forged treasures and the promise of the <em>Calydonian Messenger</em> soon to take flight, you received a crucial piece of the puzzle for your resident Dragonslayer. Volkan, the grizzled smith, pulled Kain aside, speaking of weapons forged by Gygans—god-killers—and of a horned scholar named Chondrus who hoards them on the fortified Isle of Yonder. A new, dangerous path revealed itself.</p>
<p>With goodbyes said and Tharok taking up the solemn duty of guarding the newly adopted baby basilisk, Bjorn, you began the journey east. A swift river passage gave way to a tense, moonlit trek through the woods. Your approach was anything but subtle, leading you directly into a clearing where a bizarre ritual was underway: a dozen goatlings dancing wildly around an uprooted tree. A tense standoff ensued, with Rhy-At's offering of cheap liquor met with confusion and pan pipes. After shrugging off a boot-full of snakes, Rhy-At's commanding presence, followed by Nikandros's silver-tongued persuasion, not only cowed the creatures but saw you leaving with a <em>Goodberry Tonic</em> for your troubles—a tribute from the intimidated beast-men.</p>
<p>You arrived at the Sour Vintage at the ungodly hour of 4:30 AM to a sight both familiar and changed. The tavern, now a monument to your previous heroism, was grander than you remembered. The star-struck stable boy, Marcus, offered Zephyrion the finest stall in the house before you spent the early morning hours exploring the waking town. Zephyrion secured a complimentary hoof-trim and brand-new shoes by recounting his epic deeds, while Rhy-At established a holy shrine to the five gods under a large tree, consecrating the ground.</p>
<p>As the tavern came to life, so did the whispers of your destination. You were welcomed with cheers and free drinks, but the mood shifted as you sought information on the Dead Falls. Alexios, a former smuggler, spoke in hushed tones of a partner lost to the falls, of passages that flood without warning, and a ghost ship sighted in a hidden inlet. His words were a chilling omen, though his paranoia didn't stop Kain from haggling him down with masterful skill to acquire a magical <em>Goblin Mask</em> for a steal. More warnings came from Corax the hunter, who spoke of a deathly silence that falls at midnight, of canyon walls that look like screaming faces, and his unnerving certainty that they <em>breathe</em>.</p>
<p>Amidst the grim portents, the tavern was alive with character. Zephyrion, in a display of pure, unadulterated confidence, received a... <em>thorough</em> glistening with scented oils from the merchant Philomena. Nikandros brought a smile to the face of the grieving war widow, Margot, over a game of cards, unknowingly earning the ire of a jealous onlooker.</p>
<p>You now stand on the precipice, the boisterous life of the Sour Vintage behind you and the chilling, supernatural tales of the Dead Falls echoing in your minds. The path ahead is treacherous, the warnings are dire, and the legendary ghost ship <em>Ultros</em> awaits.</p>

<h1 id="06252025"><strong>06/25/2025</strong></h1>
<p>Previously, on OODL D\&amp;D!</p>
<p>Our heroes, fresh from their triumph in the reptilian cultist warrens and having narrowly escaped the Maw of the Pit, plunged into the murky depths of Mytros's malfunctioning sewers. After confronting a foul Otyugh and clearing the larval growths, they emerged victorious, having saved the city's waterworks and rescued innocents .</p>
<p>But the true test of their heroism began when Queen Vallus herself summoned them! Trellus and Septia, the insidious Lutherian cultists who smuggled children, were brought before the Queen in chains, their vile deeds exposed by your unwavering efforts. With justice served, Queen Vallus revealed her true purpose: a vital quest to the Mithral Forge beneath the Great Falls of Arkelon, to commission an item crucial to Thylea's fate.</p>
<p>As a testament to their valor, the Queen offered a selection of powerful artifacts. Through eloquent persuasion (and perhaps a bit of well-placed flattery!), the party convinced her to grant them two of these legendary items: the versatile Wand of Switch Step and the incredibly potent Robe of the Weave. Yet, with the rewards came a hushed, critical warning: DO NOT deliver King Acastus's coveted <em>Ultros</em> to him, as his obsession with glory risks the ship falling into the wrong hands.</p>
<p>After indulging in a well-deserved Hero's Feast at the palace, curing Tharok's sewer plague and bolstering their very life force , the heroes ventured into the seedy Satyrs' Tail bar. Nikandros wowed the crowd with a mesmerizing performance, conjuring squirrels to re-enact their recent sewer battle, earning a tidy sum . Meanwhile, Kain's contacts proved invaluable, as Sari the Knight divulged crucial rumors about Queen Thessalia, a hidden underwater tunnel leading to Themis, and even a monstrous, mutated Hydra guarding the Amazons' lair .</p>
<p>The next morning, after a productive shopping spree for vital potions and gear, the party booked passage on</p>
<p>The Swift Dawn, a speedy riverboat captained by the no-nonsense Captain Stormwind . Nikandros's bardic prowess once again shone, conjuring a perfect tailwind with his harp and reducing their travel time to a mere four hours.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at the Mithral Forge, a place bustling with activity and the clang of hammers, the party used a clever</p>
<p>Mage Hand to open the secret waterfall entrance. Inside, they were greeted by Pyra and Vulcan, the divine smiths themselves! Pyra presented their first commission: the</p>
<p>Cloak of Magic Immunity, an extraordinary garment capable of rendering its wearer immune to hostile spells .</p>
<p>But the surprises didn't end there! Vulcan unveiled a damaged yet magnificent construct, a</p>
<p>Calydonian messenger from ancient times . For a thousand gold pieces and two Mithril ingots (generously provided by the party from their own stash!), this majestic flying courier will soon be repaired, capable of delivering items and materials directly to them, wherever their adventures may lead . And to top it all off, Tharok received an unexpected and adorable new companion:</p>
<p>Baby Bjorn, a baby basilisk, now his responsibility to nurture and feed !</p>
<p>The journey continues, with powerful artifacts in hand, a loyal new companion, and a flying messenger on the way, the heroes are more ready than ever to face the trials ahead!</p>
<h1 id="-_1">---</h1>
<h1 id="06182025"><strong>06/18/2025</strong></h1>
<p>Heroes of the Prophecy! Your work in the foul warrens of the reptilian cultists had reached its bloody crescendo. Before you, the shaman Vrask led his followers in a religious frenzy, their chilling chants echoing over a dark, abyssal pit. You moved as one, silent shadows in the gloom, and unleashed a surprise attack. Arrow and arcane power silenced the guards, and Zephyrion's trident thrust silenced the shaman, ending his foul ritual. But your victory was met not with silence, but with a sickening, guttural sound of crunching bones from the darkness below.</p>
<p>From the chasm's edge, a horror was birthed—the Maw of the Pit, a terrifying mass of flesh and bone-like legs. And as you battled this aberration, a greater terror emerged: the Gullet Sovereign, a massive, veiny tendril with a giant mouth, rose from the abyss to challenge you.</p>
<p>The battle that followed was a desperate struggle for survival. The Sovereign's powerful strikes battered the party, grappling both Tharok and Rhy-at, and knocking the sorcerer unconscious with a brutal blow. But in a flash of lightning and rage, Tharok unleashed the power of his axe, blasting the tendril and freeing his companion from its grasp.</p>
<p>With the Maw of the Pit destroyed by Rhy-at's fiery magic, Tharok performed a legendary feat. He launched himself from a ledge, axe in hand, and plunged into the pit, delivering the final, decisive blow that sent the Gullet Sovereign collapsing into a lifeless heap.</p>
<p>In the gory aftermath, you descended into the pit to survey the carnage and claim your spoils. Amidst the slime and shattered bones, you discovered a trove of riches, including 1,600 gold pieces, precious gems, and an ornate hammer pulsing with the power to turn wealth into destructive force.</p>
<p>Your grim work done, you returned to the engineers. With the parts you recovered and the monsters you slew, you averted disaster in the Great Cistern. Foreman Castro, overjoyed, promised a handsome reward from the Queen awaits you on the surface.</p>
<p>Now, having taken a moment to recover and feeling a surge of new power as you reach your 7th level, you stand ready. The sewers are safer, but your journey is far from over. What will you do next?</p>

<h1 id="06112025"><strong>06/11/2025</strong></h1>
<h3 id="session-25-of-rescues-and-reptilians"><strong>Session 25: Of Rescues and Reptilians</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Heroes of the Prophecy!</strong></p>
<p>Your quest to save Mytros from drowning in its own filth brought you to the brink of disaster. In the heart of the sewer system, you found the Great Cistern (UR10) groaning under the pressure of a magical flood. There, you met the panicked Foreman Kastros and the steel-nerved Engineer Thalia, who revealed that the Chief Engineer was missing, having vanished into a dangerous, uncharted cave system to the north.</p>
<p>With the city's fate hanging by a thread, you chose the path of heroes. The indomitable ranger, <strong>Kain</strong>, forged ahead, discovering a secret entrance to the caves hidden behind a collapsed wall (UR9). With steady hands, he expertly disarmed a complex pressure-plate trap, sparing you from a deadly wash of rubble and acid bile. Beyond it, you discovered a grim, natural cavern system that was not on any city schematic: the domain of savage reptilian cultists.</p>
<p>Your infiltration was a masterclass in stealth. <strong>Kain's</strong> reconnaissance revealed the horrifying truth: the missing engineer, <strong>Talia Ironrack</strong>, was alive but held captive in a crude prison pen (UR2), awaiting a gruesome sacrificial ritual. With the aid of magic that rendered you nearly invisible to your foes, you descended upon the unsuspecting jailers. In a flash of coordinated, silent violence, you struck down the guards before they could raise an alarm, freeing not only Engineer Talia but also a grizzled worker named <strong>Old Finn</strong> and a goblin captive, <strong>Snik</strong>. After escorting the grateful survivors to safety, you turned back to the darkness, your work not yet finished.</p>
<p>United in purpose, you became vengeful shadows, purging the foul warrens of their inhabitants. You dismantled their workshops (UR7), stormed their nests (UR6), and cleansed their profane hatcheries (UR3). The Children of the Chthonic Maw fell to your righteous fury, their screeches silenced by arrow, axe, and arcane power. Now, the outer dens are quiet, littered with the bodies of the slain. But a deeper darkness awaits. From the warrens' heart (UR4), you can hear the faint, chilling chants of their shaman, <strong>Vrasq</strong>, and sense a monstrous presence stirring in the abyss.</p>
<p>You have rescued the engineer, but the source of the corruption remains. What awaits you in the sanctum of the <strong>Maw of the Pit</strong>, and can you destroy the monstrous god these creatures worship before it consumes you all?</p>

<h3 id="session-24-cogs-children-and-a-queen-of-spiders"><strong>Session 24: Cogs, Children, and a Queen of Spiders</strong></h3>
<h1 id="heroes-of-the-prophecy">Heroes of the Prophecy!</h1>
<p>You stood in the horrifying, silent cellar of the Lutherian cult, the pleading eyes of caged children before you. Faced with a grim choice, you cast aside thoughts of other threats and chose the path of true heroes. Smashing the cages and gathering the terrified souls, you navigated the foul sewers one last time, emerging into the light to deliver them to the safety of Queen Vallus's palace. Her valet, Makaira, took the children into her care, promising to feed and comfort them while you provided the grim evidence of the cult's depravity—the head of their magical Shield Guardian.</p>
<p>With the children safe, your duty called you back to the city's underbelly. Your journey led you to the thundering heart of the sewer system: Volkan's Dynamo, a cavernous hall of shrieking metal and arcing lightning. There you met its beleaguered caretakers: the gruff dwarven chief engineer, Petros "Ironhand" Galanis, and his brilliant assistant, Elara. They revealed the catastrophic truth: the entire sewer system was on the brink of collapse, and only two unique components could save it. With the fate of Mytros's foundations on your shoulders, you accepted the quest: retrieve the Aetheric Capacitor from the northern domes and a Vulcan-Forged Pressure Valve from the flooded eastern cisterns.</p>
<p>Choosing the north, you ventured into a labyrinth of Web-Clogged Domes. The air grew thick with a cloying chemical sweetness, and the passages were choked with deliberate, artistic webs that seemed to guide you toward a deeper horror. After discovering the desiccated, drained corpse of a city worker wrapped in silk, you found the entrance to the lair.</p>
<p>Before you lay a vast cavern, dominated by a luminous green lagoon, pulsating egg sacs, and cocooned bodies swaying in the gloom. A chilling, melodious voice echoed from the darkness, welcoming you to her tapestry. The broodmother, Eurysphex, had found you.</p>
<p>The battle that followed was a desperate, tactical brawl. After preparing with haste and blessings, Kain's flaming arrows provoked the queen from her perch high above. She retaliated with powerful magic and summoned her brood, but not before Rhy-At unleashed a devastating, empowered <em>Fireball</em> that incinerated her webbing, sending the spider queen plummeting 60 feet to the ground! Enraged, Eurysphex unleashed her villainous power, transforming into a massive, terrifying version of herself. In a bizarre twist of fate, she then polymorphed the mighty Tharok into a tiny, furious rat! Yet even in this form, his barbarian rage was unstoppable, and he landed a savage opportunity-attack bite on a spiderling.</p>
<p>As the spider queen retreated to the ceiling once more, Andrew Lynx cleverly targeted her web anchor with precise <em>Eldritch Blasts</em>, causing her to fall a second time! Battered and enraged, the broodmother was swarmed. After a furious exchange where Zephyrion and a now-restored Tharok endured multiple venomous bites, the mighty minotaur fought through the poison in his veins. In a brutal display of strength, he hacked off both of the queen's fangs and buried his greataxe in her head, finally silencing the chittering horror.</p>
<p>In the aftermath, you recovered the Aetheric Capacitor and a trove of treasure, including a magnificent, glowing bow that can fire arrows of pure energy. You took a short rest, victorious but wounded, the first part of your quest complete.</p>
<p>Now, one component is secured, but another remains. What new monstrosities lie waiting in the flooded Grand Cistern to the east, guarding the final piece needed to save Mytros from drowning in its own filth? Your journey through the depths is far from over!</p>
<h1 id="_2"></h1>
<h1 id="_3"></h1>
<h1 id="05232025-session-23-of-thieves-traps-and-tender-souls"><strong>05/23/2025</strong> <strong>Session 23: Of Thieves, Traps, and Tender Souls</strong></h1>
<p>Heroes of the Prophecy! Your last foray into the stinking bowels of Mytros left you at the precipice of a tense standoff, the severed head of a plague worm your gruesome calling card to the wary denizens of a Thieves' Guild hideout.</p>
<p>With Lydia, the flustered lover of the recently deceased goblin Klax, as your unwilling ambassador, and Tharok's booming, perhaps reckless, claim of association with the Lady of Coins, the heavy bar on the guild's door was finally drawn back. You stepped into the heart of the "Cult of the Snake's" lair – a bustling, multi-level common room and tavern teeming with the city's underbelly. Here you met its leaders: the sharp-eyed Vassilos, his scarred lieutenant Daskalos, the quick-witted Mira, the boorish Grigor the Gut, the skittish goblin Petros the Rat, and the unsettlingly calm Sister Eudoxia, a priestess of the natural world.</p>
<p>While Tharok sampled Grigor's potent moonshine and Serpent's Bite liquor, Kain's keen eyes spotted a formidable guardian in an adjoining vault: Bronsidon, a massive, adamantine pill-bug automaton. Rhy-At, drawing upon his deep knowledge, recognized the masterful craftsmanship of Volkan, the God of the Forge, in the ancient sentinel. The guild members, clearly nervous when questioned about the Cult of Lutheria, admitted to "lifting" wine casks from their rivals but vehemently denied any knowledge of smuggled children, expressing genuine horror at the thought.</p>
<p>The night offered a brief respite. After a much-needed bath to wash away the sewer's filth (with Zephyrion even indulging in Sister Eudoxia's rose-scented oils), the party took a long rest, with Rhy-At and Kain standing vigilant guard. Lydia, still reeling from her ordeal and now nursing a hangover, was offered Klax's (looted) amulet by Andrew Lynx in a bid to soothe her, though she remained inconsolable.</p>
<p>It was now Sunday morning. Seeking the Cult of Lutheria, you received directions from Grigor to head north of the hideout, with warnings of "little reptile folk" and cobweb-laden tunnels. Grigor let you out of the hideout, which apparently had an exit leading to a ladder behind the Siren's Roost – the notorious brothel in Stygian Row.</p>
<p>Navigating more treacherous sewer tunnels, Kain expertly manipulated sluice gates, at one point unleashing a torrent of pressurized storm drain water that thankfully didn't wash anyone away. Progressing north, Kain detected an invisible presence near a ladder. A potent Dispel Magic from Andrew Lynx rent the illusion, revealing a formidable Shield Guardian, its metallic hide etched with the symbols of Lutheria. This guardian, as Rhy-At and Andrew deduced from its blindsight, immunities, and regenerative capabilities, was clearly a powerful sentinel.</p>
<p>An attempt by Rhy-At to bluff the construct by disguising himself and others as replacement guards was met with a cryptic demand: "Dreamers halt before the ladies' veil parts. Recite the lullaby that stoppers with minds speak or drown in violets.". Unable to decipher the password, you chose violence. Those who hid their intent well (Nicandros, Andrew, and Kain) struck first. The construct retaliated, regenerating wounds and unleashing a field of grasping Black Tentacles that ensnared most of the party. After a fierce exchange, highlighted by Rhy-At's clever use of Mind Sliver to weaken its resolve followed by a quickened barrage of Magic Missiles that shattered its concentration, Tharok's mighty greataxe finally felled the mechanical warden. Zephyrion claimed its spell-storing head, while Kain skillfully extracted its valuable breastplate, though the spell-storing plate proved too difficult to salvage.</p>
<p>Ascending the ladder the Shield Guardian had protected, you found yourselves in a grim, magically silenced chamber. Behind iron bars, several children peered out from squalid cells, their silent pleas a horrifying testament to the depravity of the Cult of Lutheria. This, you realized, was the cult's hidden cellar, the destination of those "small casks" mentioned in Malachor's ledger.</p>
<p>The session closed with a chilling discovery and a heavy choice: rescue the children now, potentially alerting the full force of the Lutherian cult, or delve deeper into the remaining sewer warrens to eliminate other threats first? The fate of these young souls, and your path forward, hangs precariously in the balance. What terrors, and what desperate hopes, will your next steps uncover in the shadowed depths of Mytros?</p>

<h2 id="dd-session-recap-from-colossus-to-cesspool-mayhem-in-the-mytros-sewers"><strong>D\&amp;D Session Recap: From Colossus to Cesspool – Mayhem in the Mytros Sewers!</strong></h2>
<p>Heroes of the Prophecy! Your daring infiltration of the Colossus of Pythor culminated in a tense bargain with <strong>Moxena, the Lady of Coins</strong>, leader of the <strong>Thieves' Guild known as the "Cult of the Snake."</strong> With an agreement struck to aid her against her sisters on Themis in exchange for her ceasing criminal operations in Mytros, you descended from the mechanical titan's leg into the stinking, malfunctioning sewers beneath the city – a realm Rhy-At knew housed the city's troubled waterworks. After a brief skirmish with an Otyugh-like horror, you pressed on into the unknown depths.</p>
<p><strong>The Descent into Foul Waters:</strong></p>
<p>Your sewer exploration quickly became a hands-on lesson in ancient plumbing. Cautiously approaching a sluice gate, <strong>Nicandros</strong>, with a clever use of Mage Hand, unleashed a torrent, gradually draining a vast chamber. Ominous claw marks on the gate hinted at unseen dangers. While <strong>Rhy-At</strong> considered a full "acid wash" of the massive room (a familiar chore from his temple days!), the party opted to wait for the waters to recede.</p>
<p>Investigations revealed a colossal, damaged sewer pipe. The ever-vigilant <strong>Kain</strong> scouted ahead through another sluice, navigating a treacherous system of tiered water levels. It was here, cloaked in invisibility, that he first sensed it – a "Grick" creature, sniffing the air but failing to pinpoint the hidden ranger.</p>
<p><strong>An Organ of Ill Omen and a Worm from the Depths:</strong></p>
<p>The dank tunnels eventually opened into a chamber dominated by a peculiar, ornate organ. <strong>Tharok</strong>, never shy of experimentation, sat down to play. His initial haunting notes soon gave way to a cacophony as he pressed multiple keys, unleashing a disgusting blast of "poo vapors" that even his sturdy minotaur constitution barely withstood! Undeterred, Tharok's bizarre symphony continued, and from the echoing depths of the sewer, a gigantic, wailing, guttural roar answered his call.</p>
<p>The music disturbed more than just the air. In a nearby chamber, the waters began to froth and churn violently. Suddenly, a massive, slimy tentacle erupted, lashing out at the startled <strong>Kain</strong> and <strong>Rhy-At</strong>! Combat was joined as the dreaded <strong>Plague Worm</strong> surfaced!</p>
<p>The battle was a desperate struggle in the muck and mire. <strong>Rhy-At</strong> unleashed potent Mind Slivers and a scorching, empowered Fireball. <strong>Kain</strong>, a blur of motion, peppered the beast with arrows, his attempt to ensnare it with a net proving futile as the worm's bulk shredded it. The goddess <strong>Kyra</strong>, taking refuge on <strong>Zephyrion's</strong> broad back, offered divine encouragement while <strong>Andrew Lynx</strong> pummeled the monstrosity with relentless Eldritch Blasts.</p>
<p>The Plague Worm fought back with terrifying ferocity, its Tentacular Tongue grappling heroes and its Putrid Bile spewing forth in a sickening wave. <strong>Zephyrion</strong>, after <strong>Nicandros</strong> freed a comrade by blasting a tentacle apart with necrotic energy from his mace, charged into the fray. He landed mighty blows with his Kopis and the chilling Trident of Kenta-Mean, but the worm's retaliatory strike was devastating, and Zephyrion fell unconscious into the filth!</p>
<p>Seeing his companion fall, <strong>Kain</strong> channeled the divine power of the Radiance of Mytros sword, its holy light bringing Zephyrion back to his feet, albeit bloodied. The heroes pressed their advantage, weathering the worm's legendary resistances. Finally, grievously wounded, the Plague Worm turned to flee, slithering beneath the murky surface. But <strong>Kain</strong>, enraged, gave chase. Vanishing into the shadows, he unleashed a final, perfectly aimed volley of three arrows, striking true and felling the grotesque beast!</p>
<p><strong>Treasures, Tortured Poultry, and Troublesome Thugs:</strong></p>
<p>In the aftermath, <strong>Kain</strong> grimly beheaded the bloated corpse. Sifting through its vile innards, <strong>Rhy-At</strong> made a startling discovery: the remains of a <strong>Thieves' Guild</strong> member and an ornate chest. Within the chest lay ten flawless crystal vials – five shimmering crimson, five vibrant azure – alongside a cryptic poem. "Crimson drinks the mountain's height. Azure sips the fading light... But should you mix the red and blue, a storm of nature comes for you." With a successful Arcana check, <strong>Nikandros</strong> deduced the crimson potion enlarged, while the azure shrank.</p>
<p>What followed was a truly... unique... scientific endeavor upon your trusty chicken, Henrietta. Administering a thimbleful of <em>both</em> potions simultaneously resulted in a chaotic, grotesque transformation. The poor bird began to wildly expand and contract, different parts growing and shrinking at random, all while squawking in what could only be described as poultry anguish. After much soul-searching and concern over its prolonged, unnatural suffering (and the noise it was making!), and after its headless body continued to pulsate, the decision was made to end its misery, though its remains, still erratically morphing, were bagged for... reasons.</p>
<p>After a much-needed short rest, you continued your exploration, soon encountering a heavy, locked iron door. <strong>Kain's</strong> skilled hands made short work of the lock. However, as he pulled the door open, a beefy goblin appeared, promptly slammed it shut, and relocked it! Not to be deterred, Kain picked the lock <em>again</em>, this time with the party ready for action. As the door swung inward, revealing a room with several thugs and a Yuan-ti, arrows flew!</p>
<p>The ensuing fight was swift and decisive. <strong>Nikandros</strong> launched Toll the Dead, <strong>Andrew</strong> expertly counterspelled a <em>Suggestion</em> aimed at Tharok before unleashing a barrage of Eldritch Blasts. <strong>Tharok</strong>, in a barbarian rage, charged past the frontline to engage the Yuan-ti spellcaster. <strong>Rhy-At's</strong> Chromatic Orbs and <strong>Kain's</strong> deadly arrows quickly dispatched the remaining foes. The hideout was secured, its alarm unrung.</p>
<p>Looting the fallen yielded some coin, a tarnished silver serpent ring (another nod to the Thieves' Guild), and an amulet from the goblin boss. Yet another locked door stood before you. <strong>Kain</strong>, proving himself the master of unlocking, opened it to a startling sight: a rather skanky-looking human woman, Lydia, and another goblin boss, mid-embrace!</p>
<p>Interrupted and clearly flustered, the pair prepared for a fight. <strong>Rhy-At</strong> was first to act, slicing the woman's mind with a Mind Sliver. <strong>Zephyrion</strong>, leaping dramatically over his comrades, charged the goblin boss, felling him with two brutal throws of his trident. The terrified Lydia, now alone, was subjected to questioning by a sewer-stench-covered <strong>Kain</strong>. She confirmed that you had indeed stumbled into a hideout of the <strong>Thieves' Guild (the "Cult of the Snake")</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>A Cliffhanger Deception:</strong></p>
<p>The session concluded on a razor's edge. Another door remained, behind which more Guild members were undoubtedly alerted. A desperate, convoluted plan was hatched: Lydia, thoroughly intimidated by <strong>Tharok</strong> and the still-twitching bag containing Henrietta's remains, was coerced into approaching the door. <strong>Rhy-At</strong> even offered his skills in disguise. Lydia knocked, nervously uttered the password ("avocado!"). A slot opened, and a suspicious voice questioned her. Her quavering response immediately raised alarms. Thinking fast, <strong>Tharok</strong> boomed that they were associates of Moxena, the Lady of Coins, and had just saved Lydia from the monstrous Plague Worm, brandishing its severed head as undeniable proof!</p>
<p>The Guild members on the other side, though confused by the sight of the gruesome trophy, sternly ordered you to step back from the door…</p>
<p>And that's where the darkness, and the session, closed! Will your bold, perhaps reckless, deception succeed? What awaits behind that final door? And what other secrets do the Mytros sewers still hold?</p>
<p>We'll find out next time!</p>
<h1 id="04302025">04/30/2025</h1>
<p>Heroes of the Prophecy, the battle within the Colossus of Pythor raged on, the noxious green gas swirling around you as the Minotaur Hero desperately fought. Rhy-At shielded himself with illusory duplicates while Tharok, fueled by rage and Nicandros's haste, relentlessly pressed the attack against the gas-releasing minotaur. Kain, though suffering the poison's effects, landed telling shots with his bow. Andrew Lynx's arcane blasts sought targets, while Zephyrion contended with the surprisingly resilient gladiator lady who had managed to break free from his crushing grapple, only to be struck down again by his swift reaction.</p>
<p>Tharok's mighty axe finally silenced the Minotaur Hero, whose dying breath cursed you for slaying their "savior." Facing the imposing minotaur alone, the remaining warrior, Kragnos, surrendered under Tharok's fierce intimidation. With the immediate threat subdued, Tharok closed the hissing valve, stopping the flow of poison, and Zephyrion quickly applied the Mithral Thread bandages purchased from Talia, miraculously purging the lingering poison from Kain's system. A quick search yielded coin, gems, and gear from the fallen foes, including a vial of noxious sludge Kragnos identified simply as "shit." Tharok allowed the defeated minotaur to depart, warning him away.</p>
<p>Pressing upwards, you passed through chambers filled with more strange machinery – an acidic-smelling torso room (C4) and a chest chamber (C5) housing a massive furnace heart. Here, thugs and other shady figures played cards, interrupting their game to eye your party warily. A watchful drow demanded a password, but Tharok, thinking quickly, bluffed passage by invoking Kragnos's name and mentioning a need to see "Moxina" about lucrative business, a gamble that surprisingly paid off.</p>
<p>Ascending finally into the head of the Colossus (C6), you found yourselves in the lair of the Lady of Coins herself. The Medusa, Moxena, lounged amidst lifelike statues – her petrified victims – under the eerie glow of a central control orb. A tense negotiation began. Confronting her about her trafficking operations for the dragon Hexia and her ties to the Isle of Themis, Moxena revealed fragmented truths about her business and her exiled Amazonian sisters. Offers and counter-offers flew: her demand for Lord Neurdagon's head, your refusal, her offer to join your voyage if you helped her against her sisters. After much deliberation and a masterful persuasion by the party, a deal was struck. Moxena would cease her criminal activities in Mytros and aid you on your journey <em>after</em> you leave the city, meeting you via her contacts near the Satyr's Tail. In return, you agreed to help her confront her usurper sisters on Themis, leaving Lord Neurdagon out of the arrangement for now. Satisfied, she permitted you to leave, requesting only that you fix the door you destroyed on your way out.</p>
<p>Before departing the Colossus entirely, you chose to investigate the alternate passage downward from the belly chamber – the Colossus's other leg. Descending a makeshift ladder, you entered the foul-smelling Mytros sewers. Rhy-At recalled this area housed the city's waterworks, known to be malfunctioning since Sydon's storm. Kain scouted ahead through the muck, spotting strange larval growths on the walls (which Andrew subsequently destroyed with Acid Splash) and glimpsing a large, unidentified creature moving beneath the murky water before it vanished. Moments later, a giant rat was snatched from the path by a massive tentacle-like limb erupting from the sludge. An Otyugh-like monstrosity emerged, which the party swiftly dispatched. Kain, scouting further, discovered a sewer exit leading directly to the Mytros shipyards, though not near the known berth of Varkon's <em>Moist Maiden</em>.</p>
<p>Having cleared the Colossus and struck a precarious bargain with the Lady of Coins, you now stand at a crossroads within the stinking depths of the Mytros sewers, facing unknown paths, potential connections to the Temple of Lutheria, and the lingering presence of monstrous inhabitants...</p>
