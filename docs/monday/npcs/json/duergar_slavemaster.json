These vicious duergar use a combination of their flails and whips to punish and prod humans, orcs, kobolds, and any other wretched creature into hard labor or forced battles. While sergeants and other leaders use their commanding presence to maneuver allies in combat, slave masters use pain and punishment to force slaves to do their bidding, often ending up as fodder in battle."
