The duergar's cruel magic forces it to channel its elemental essence through the foundry's machinery, creating the immense heat and power needed for their dark works. Its rocky form writhes with veins of molten stone, and its eyes burn with the fury of a caged volcano. If freed, it seeks immediate vengeance against its captors before attempting to return to its home plane."
