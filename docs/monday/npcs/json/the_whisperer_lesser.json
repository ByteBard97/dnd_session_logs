    "description": "Lesser Whisperers are juvenile or weakened variants of the dreaded Whisperer. While not as powerful as their full-grown counterparts, they retain the same unsettling ability to communicate telepathically and manipulate the minds of their prey.",
    "behavior": "Unlike the full Whisperer, Lesser Whisperers are more opportunistic hunters, preferring to ambush lone travelers or small groups. They often use their hypnotic abilities to lure victims into underwater caves or dark pools.",
    "origins": "Some scholars believe Lesser Whisperers are spawn of the greater creature, while others theorize they are the result of the Whisperer's influence corrupting ordinary cephalopods over time.",
    "tactics": "A Lesser Whisperer typically tries to charm the strongest-looking opponent first, then uses its tentacles to grapple multiple enemies while retreating to deeper water where it has the advantage."
