  "bio": "Master Smith Durkal is the undisputed master of the Cinderfork Foundry's forges. His focus is entirely on the physical craft, the purity of the metal, and the quality of the arms produced. He moves with the brute force and confidence of someone who has spent a lifetime bending steel to his will. In a fight, he is a terrifying whirlwind of hammer blows, using his psionic ability to become a giant, embodying the raw power of the forge."
