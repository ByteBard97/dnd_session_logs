  "bio": "The Black Loch Keelhauler is a powerful aquatic monstrosity, prized by the corsairs and slavers of the Underdark as a peerless beast of burden. Its long, muscular body and powerful fins allow it to tow vessels weighing several tons for days on end without tiring. A Keelhauler's most distinct feature is the series of bony, hooked ridges that flank its spine. These are not part of its skeleton, but rather growths of dense, flexible cartilage that can be pierced with minimal harm to the creature."
