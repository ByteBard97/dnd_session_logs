The Summons at The Sour Vintage Inn  </li> <li>Keerah's Summons: We were summoned to The Sour Vintage Inn, located twenty miles east of Estoria. Keerah, a renowned poet, revealed herself to be an agent of the Oracle. She informed us of our great destiny and tasked us with hunting a corrupted giant boar, unleashed by the Titans, Sydon and Lutheria, to terrorize the Heartlands.  </li> <li>The Task: Keerah explained that the boar was a symbol of the weakening Oath of Peace, which once protected the mortals of Thylea from the wrath of the Titans. This boar had already slain many, and Keerah urged us to prove ourselves as the heroes of prophecy by slaying the beast.  </li> <li>2. The Hunt for the Corrupted Boar  </li> <li>Journey into the Heartlands: We set off at dawn, guided by two scouts, Taneias and Javon. The morning was cold and foggy as we ventured northward, passing ravaged farms and gouged trees\u2014grim signs of the boar's rampage.  </li> <li>The Battle: We tracked the boar to its lair, a cave strewn with the remains of its victims. The beast ambushed us, and in the ensuing battle, one of our scouts, Taneias, was tragically slain.   </li> <li>Aella launched her mighty chakram at the beast, slitting its throat and laying it low. We emerged victorious, slaying the corrupted boar.  </li> <li>The Boar's Prophecy: Before it died, the boar spoke to us in our minds, warning of an ancient power that sleeps in Thylea and prophesying doom and darkness for all mortal things. It claimed that no prophecy would save us from this fate.  </li> <li>3. The Sacrifice and Return to The Sour Vintage  </li> <li>Honoring Pythor: Following Aella's advice, we burned the remains of the boar as a sacrificial offering to Pythor, the god of battle. In doing so, we hoped to honor him and gain his favor in the battles to come.   </li> <li>Aella intuits the favor of Pythor, god of Battle.  </li> <li>We recover some treasure and a magical silver spear, which is held by Rheana.  </li> <li>Return to The Sour Vintage: We returned to The Sour Vintage Inn as heroes. The townsfolk greeted us with cheers and gratitude for freeing them from the terror of the boar. We spent the evening resting and reflecting on the day's events.  </li> <li>Astreaus played an amazing performance regaling the audience with tales and song of our mighty deeds. He made a lot of gold in the process.  </li> <li>Level up to 2  </li> <li>4. The Oracle's Prophecy  </li> <li>The Next Step: The following day, Kyrah reminded us of the importance of visiting the Oracle at her temple to the east. She believes that the Oracle, Versi, will reveal the next steps in our journey and provide us with guidance on how to avert the coming catastrophe.  </li> <li>Journey to the Temple: We set off through the wilderness, leaving behind the comfort of The Sour Vintage and traveling through the Heartlands toward the temple. The journey took us nearly a day, and we arrived at the temple, ready to learn what the Oracle has foreseen.  </li> <li>5.

flames erupted but were dampened by your quick thinking, allowing you to reach the lower levels singed but alive.  </li> <li>The Silent Armory </li> <li>Stepping into a vast armory once brimming with legendary weapons, you found only echoes of the past.  </li> <li>Empty racks and shattered armaments told stories of looting and time's relentless decay.  </li> <li>Despite thorough searching, valuable relics eluded you, perhaps hidden or long removed.  </li> <li>Encounter with the Forgekeeper </li> <li>Moving south, you discovered a grand chamber dominated by a bubbling pool of lava\u2014a creature swam beneath its molten surface.  </li> <li>Two death dogs guarded an enigmatic bronze sphere with a protruding spout.  </li> <li>Without hesitation, Aella led the charge against the guardians.  </li> <li>Rheana invoked the Fear of the Dragonlords , her presence unsettling the death dogs and giving you the upper hand.  </li> <li>Upon their defeat, a serpentine figure emerged from the lava\u2014the salamander known as Pyra, the Forgekeeper.  </li> <li>She warned of the enchanted sphere, a deadly trap designed by the dwarves to keep her bound.  </li> <li>Disarming the Frozen Trap </li> <li>Investigating the sphere, you attempted to disable it but only delayed its activation.  </li> <li>As ominous clicks sounded, Pyra urged you to flee before a blast of freezing magic engulfed the room.  </li> <li>Refusing to be thwarted, you heaved the sphere onto Rheana's sturdy back.  </li> <li>With a combined effort, you hurled it over the edge, watching as it plummeted into the waterfall below\u2014its icy explosion freezing the cascading waters momentarily.  </li> <li>Alliance with Pyra </li> <li>Grateful for your intervention, Pyra introduced herself and revealed her plight.  </li> <li>Tricked by the dwarves, she had been bound to power the forge for centuries.  </li> <li>She offered to reignite the legendary Mithral Forge if you agreed to destroy the rune tablet anchoring her to this place.  </li> <li>Pyra cautioned you about the young cerberus ahead, a fearsome guardian sent by Lutheria herself.  </li> <li>She suggested diplomacy but remained ready to assist in battle if needed.  </li> <li>The Fierce Battle with the Cerberus </li> <li>Undeterred, Delphi approached the cerberus, attempting to negotiate.  </li> <li>The beast snarled, its three heads echoing with malice, and vowed to devour you all.  </li> <li>The fight was brutal\u2014the cerberus's powerful jaws and venomous bites pushed you to your limits.  </li> <li>Pyra joined the fray, ensnaring the creature with her fiery tail and encasing one of its heads in hardened magma.  </li> <li>Amidst the chaos, several of you suffered grievous wounds and the sting of poison.  </li> <li>In a final, decisive move, Delphi unleashed a scorching firebolt, striking down the monstrous hound.  </li> <li>Liberation and Rekindling the Forge </li> <li>Among the cerberus's hoard, you found treasures and the rune tablet binding Pyra.  </li> <li>Honoring your promise, Delphi shattered the tablet;

King Driptongue and his ruthless minions began descending the dwarven elevator, determined to seize control of the forge. Defensive Preparations: </li> <li>Pyra, the fiery Forgekeeper, teamed up with the party to set up intricate traps throughout the forge, preparing for the inevitable assault by the troglodyte horde. Hordes Descend: </li> <li>A relentless wave of troglodytes launched their attack on the forge's defenses, overwhelming the party with sheer numbers and vicious ferocity. Clash with the Troglodytes: </li> <li>In a fierce and harrowing battle, the heroes fought valiantly alongside Pyra. Amidst the chaos, Pyra ensnared King Driptongue with her mighty tail, forcing him to surrender. Aella's Ruthless Justice: </li> <li>Despite King Driptongue's pleas for mercy, the unyielding Amazon Warrior, Aella, delivered a brutal end to the tyrant, ensuring he would never threaten Estoria again.  </li> <li>Pyra cautioned Aella about the repercussions of such brutality, warning that the party's reputation could suffer, but Aella remained steadfast in her actions. Pyra's Offer: </li> <li>With King Driptongue defeated, Pyra revealed her ability to craft powerful items for the heroes, offering them legendary gear in exchange for their continued assistance. Night of Terror: </li> <li>Exhausted after the day's battles, the party spent the night within the Mithral Forge. They were plagued by a terrifying dream vision from the Titan Lutheria, waking up in cold sweats and experiencing short-term madness. Centaur Gratitude: </li> <li>Following the harrowing night, the heroes returned to the banks of the Arkelon River to receive their reward from the centaurs: three potions of heroism, tokens of gratitude for rescuing their missing kin. Meeting with Volkan: </li> <li>Back in Estoria, the party consulted with Volkan, the grumpy dwarven blacksmith and true God of the Forge. He explained that he needed King Pythor's hammer to repair the party's broken weapons and armor.  </li> <li>The heroes hired Volkan to craft a special suit of plate armor for Rhaena, costing 1500 gp and taking four days to complete.  Hunting the Basilisks: </li> <li>Determined to eliminate the threat to Princess Anora, the party ventured to the Rock of Estor in search of the petrifying basilisks.  </li> <li>Delphi, utilizing his mystic abilities, summoned an octopus familiar to scout the river upstream. The octopus successfully located the basilisks' lair within a hidden cave.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"friday/logs/log_session_12.html","title":"Session 12","text":"<p>Agenda</p> <ul> <li>The Great Labors  </li> <li>~~Claim the Weapons of the Dragonlords~~  </li> <li>~~Relight the fires of the Mithral Forge~~  </li> <li>~~Drink from the Horn of Balmytria~~   </li> <li>Aella: Gather allies and return to the Isle of Themis and overthrow the usurpers who murdered your mother and stole her throne  </li> <li>Astreus: Seek out the Wisdom of Queen Vallus in Mytros to further your quest for knowledge  </li> <li>Delphi: Xander gave you your crown and his mystic armaments.

These monstrous creatures, harbingers of petrification, had claimed the lives and freedom of many\u2014including a group of ill-fated bandits now frozen in stone.  </li> <li>The Battle: You fought valiantly against these creatures, narrowly avoiding their petrifying gazes. Each strike of your weapons reverberated through the cavern, and though the battle was fierce, your resolve never wavered.  </li> <li>The Spoils of War: You harvested precious basilisk ichor, a key alchemical component. Some will be used to craft a salve to cure petrification\u2014others, perhaps, for darker purposes. From the corpse of a basilisk, you claimed its fearsome head, destined to enhance a magical shield under the skilled hands of Volkan, the God of the Forge.  </li> <li>A Choice Left Behind: Despite recovering the salve, you chose not to release the petrified bandits\u2014a somber reminder of the cost of greed and violence in the wilds of Thylea.  </li> <li>The Hidden Treasure: In the shadowy depths of the cavern, you uncovered a trapped chest filled with modest loot, adding a small glimmer of triumph to the grim surroundings. The Centaur Encampment </li> <li>On your journey back to Estoria, the sound of drums and hooves led you to the centaur encampment, where the air crackled with tension and ancient grievances.  </li> <li>Baenor's Words: Meeting with Baenor, the chieftain of the centaurs, you explained your plan to take Princess Anora's place as a sacrifice to Sydon. Baenor's sarcasm was biting as he wished you \"good luck,\" urging you to deal with Gaius and pray to your gods and ancestors\u2014for your souls were already in peril. Negotiating with Gaius </li> <li>Back in King Pythor's palace, you stood before the heavily-armored Gaius, commander of the Order of Sydon. With determination and Astreus's silver tongue, you convinced him to accept your self-sacrifice in place of Anora.  </li> <li>The Bargain Struck: Gaius reveled in the deal, mocking your bravery as four heroes offered themselves in exchange for what he considered a \"useless princess.\" However, you cunningly persuaded him to move the sacrifice to the following night, saving precious time for your preparations. A Royal Thanks </li> <li>King Pythor, overcome with gratitude, summoned Princess Anora. She tearfully thanked you for your noble choice, gifting you a magical pendant to bring you luck as you face the horrors of the Rock of Estor.  </li> <li>The King's Hammer: Pythor promised his magical hammer as your reward if you survive. This weapon, forged by Volkan and steeped in divine power, is a treasure of legend and a beacon of hope for Estoria.  </li> <li>Anora's Warning: She urged you to leave your equipment with her to avoid it being pilfered by Sydon's acolytes during the ritual. Demetria's Prison </li> <li>In the depths of Pythor's dungeon, you confronted Demetria, the vengeful dryad who once twisted innocent souls into monstrous maenads in her service to Lutheria.  </li> <li>The Heirloom's Secret: Rheana demanded the return of her family ring, a precious artifact connected to her forgotten lineage and prophecy. Demetria, bitter and defiant, refused at first but relented after being put to sleep and swearing an oath to the party.  </li> <li>The Oath Fulfilled: Bound by her words, Demetria produced the ring like a magician, conjuring it from thin air. She revealed that the Ritual Tome\u2014her dark grimoire of transformation\u2014had been a gift from her mistress, Lutheria.  </li> <li>Freedom Granted: Though wary, you honored her oath, releasing her from captivity. With haughty arrogance, Demetria departed the palace, her connection to Lutheria an ominous thread still tied to your fates. A Declaration to Estoria </li> <li>Delphi, ever the voice of the people, announced your intention to stand in Anora's stead to the bustling agora. A crowd gathered, whispering of your courage and folly in equal measure. Delphi assured them that the gods themselves would protect you, turning the sacrifice into a spectacle for all to witness. Evening Preparations </li> <li>As night fell, you each took to your tasks:  </li> <li>Astreus's Performance: At the Dragon's Tooth Inn, Astreus captivated the crowd with music, his lute case overflowing with coins by the end of the night.  </li> <li>Aella's Watchful Eye: Aella's mechanical bird soared back to the basilisk cave, ensuring no further dangers stirred within its depths.  </li> <li>Delphi's Vigil: Delphi shadowed Gaius through the darkened streets of Estoria, uncovering the location of an unassuming house frequented by acolytes of Sydon.</li> </ul> <p>Lutheria's Wrath</p> <ul> <li>In the dead of night, the shadow of Lutheria descended upon your dreams. Each of you was plagued by visions of terror and madness:  </li> <li>Rheana's Torment: Hallucinations of Lutheria's scorn haunted Rheana, her reflection twisted in the mirror and the night sky. Drawing upon her paladin's grace, she calmed her mind and banished the horrors.  </li> <li>Aella's Silence: Stricken by an unnatural dumbness, Aella's voice was stolen, leaving her unable to speak. Despite your efforts, the curse lingers, a cruel reminder of Lutheria's power.  </li> <li>A Frightened Resolve: As dawn approaches, you wake shaken but determined. The stakes have never been higher, and Lutheria has made her disdain for you clear.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"friday/logs/log_session_13.html","title":"Session 13","text":"<p>Agenda</p> <ul> <li>Aella: Gather allies and return to the Isle of Themis and overthrow the usurpers who murdered your mother and stole her throne  </li> <li>Astreus: Seek out the Wisdom of Queen Vallus in Mytros to further your quest for knowledge  </li> <li>Delphi: Xander gave you your crown and his mystic armaments.

Though framed as an act of reverence, it is a horrifying and despised option, tantamount to sacrificing the innocent.  </li> <li>Bella the Concubine: Suggests performing a traditional hecatomb\u2014sacrificing 100 oxen to placate Sydon. This option would require significant resources, depleting the livestock of Mytros and straining its economy.  </li> <li>Queen Vallus:Advocates for a miraculous act by the gods.

The harp is in the possession of Boreas, a satyr and former ally of Kyrah, who resides at a vineyard near the city. The heroes must negotiate, trick, or take the harp by force.

She identified the Cult of Lutheria as a particular threat, operating under the guise of generosity while spreading corruption and Titan influence.  </li> <li>She requested the party investigate the Temple of Lutheria in Stygian Row to uncover evidence of their malevolence, advising caution to avoid provoking chaos.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Personal Threads (Optional): <ul> <li>Vallus addressed specific party members' epic paths if applicable, offering tailored advice or quests. For instance, she mentioned the plight of the Amazons to an exile or directed a seeker of knowledge toward the Lotus Witch.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Final Warning: <ul> <li>Vallus reiterated that Acastus must not learn of the party's success with the Ultros, warning them of the dangers his control over the legendary ship could bring.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Before leaving the Queen's chambers, Aella met the Queen's Amazon   </li> <li>Makhaira's Revelation: Aella's family was betrayed, her mother slain, and Aella framed as a coward by usurpers.  </li> <li>Makhaira and her warriors were exiled for questioning the false rulers, later finding sanctuary with Queen Vallus.  </li> <li>State of Themis: Shrines to the Great Mothers destroyed, replaced by Lutheria's statues.  </li> <li>Usurpers rule through fear, with maenads and goatlings spreading chaos.  </li> <li>Loyalists to the old ways hide in secret camps.  </li> <li>Makhaira's Promise: Makhaira pledged to honor Aella's claim and support her when the time comes.  </li> <li>She encouraged Aella to prove her worth by embodying strength and wisdom to unite the Amazons.  </li> <li>Advice for Aella:  </li> <li>Seek loyalists among the hidden camps on Themis.  </li> <li>Prepare to lead with courage and inspire the sisterhood to rise against the usurpers.  </li> <li>We talk to the dragon Icarus and Delphi notices that he acts younger than a dragon of his size and age should.

We slew them after a tough battle  </li> <li>Continuing on, we reach the edge of Boreas's Vineyard.  </li> <li>We notice that the violent hurricane is not really affecting the vineyard. We can see its effects battering the countryside outside of its bounds  </li> <li>Kyrah revealed some of her past with Boreas. They had a falling out several years ago.  </li> <li>Kyrah's Past with Boreas: Kyrah, once known as Notos, was part of the Four Winds, a group of musicians who inspired others through their music. Boreas, the Winter Wind, was a former companion who became envious of the Boreal Harp's power.  </li> <li>Betrayal and Conflict: Boreas, influenced by Lutheria, stole the Boreal Harp after feeling betrayed when Kyrah shifted her focus to helping others, like the party. He now resides in the vineyard and will not part with the harp willingly.  </li> <li>Kyrah's Regret and Warning: Kyrah expresses regret for not revealing this sooner, acknowledges her past failures, and warns the party to be cautious with Boreas, who thrives on chaos. She places her trust in them to succeed where she could not.  </li> <li>We enter the vineyard and wonder at the bounty of delectable grapes  </li> <li>We discover the Sylvan compass and Astreus reads the script around it in Sylvan, although we don't figure out what its purpose is  </li> <li>We knock on the front door of the Villa and are met by the Evelina. She is taking care of the two Satyr children.   </li> <li>She asks us if we are here to buy wine and we tell her we are looking for Boreus. She says he is not at home and offers us two varieties of delicious wine, one of which casts \"calm emotions\" on us.  </li> <li>We convince her to let us stay the night and she agrees for a price of 10 silver each.  </li> <li>She says we can walk up the river and go look for Boreus who is probably playing his harp and entertaining the river nymphs. She says for us to come back in an hour or two and she will feed us dinner. We will stay in the guest room and she will make us a hot bath.  </li> <li>We follow the river north and discover Boreas playing his harp for a bunch of river spirits. When we approach they all leap into the river and disappear from sight.  </li> <li>He addresses us with disdain and sarcasm, implying that Kyrah is using us.   </li> <li>Delphi starts talking to him to try and get him to act more agreeable to us. Delphi rolls very poorly on his persuasion check and the party's bard Astreus swoops in, using his powers of persuasion and rescues the situation. Astresus rolls very well on his persuasion and gets Boreas to warm to the party. He agrees to come back to the Villa and eat dinner and play music with the party and Kyrah.  </li> <li>We return to the Villa and have a nice dinner and magical wine. and play music and recount old times together</li> </ul>"},{"location":"friday/logs/log_session_15.html","title":"Session 15","text":"<p>Agenda</p> <ul> <li>Aella: Gather allies and return to the Isle of Themis and overthrow the usurpers who murdered your mother and stole her throne  </li> <li>Astreus: Queen Vallus has guided you to seek out the Lotus Witch, who may possess the fabled grimoire you need for your chronicles.

Yet the truth proved more complex - it was Moxena who had discovered young Aella that bloody night, and rather than following orders to kill the child, had secretly arranged her escape.  </li> <li>Having failed in her own later attempt to overthrow her sisters, Moxena now offers an alliance from her bronze sanctuary: aid in Aella's quest to reclaim her rightful throne, but first demands proof of loyalty - Lord Neurdagon's head. Three petrified victims stand as silent witnesses to your oath, sworn not to reveal her hidden stronghold within the ancient Colossus.  </li> <li>The pieces of prophecy begin to align - the Oracle's words about finding an ally \"in the head of god\" now ring with new meaning, though whether Moxena's offer represents salvation or a deeper betrayal remains to be seen.

The final prize, the second Brass Dragon Egg, lay hidden within the sweltering cave of the salamanders, Ignis and Cindra. Testing the cracked, glowing floor proved perilous, as Astraeus discovered when his foot ignited upon contact! Prudence demanded another approach.  </p> <p>Harnessing potent magic, Delphi and Aella prepared potions of Spider Climb, while Astraeus invoked his enchanted lute to take flight. With Delphi scaling the walls like an arachnid, Astraeus floated into the cavern, confronting the protective salamanders. Wielding Jankor's captured Staff of Thunder and Lightning, Astraeus channeled newfound authority, mixing diplomacy with intimidation. Though wary, the salamanders yielded before the symbol of their fallen master and the party's demonstrated power, allowing you to claim the ancient Brass Dragon Egg \u2013 a key step in Delphi's path as the Vanished One. While there, Delphi also skillfully extracted several of the strange, humming red crystals embedded in the cave walls.  </p> <p>Rallying your allies \u2013 the rescued Bloodscale warriors, the young dragonling Pyraxis (now fixated on the second egg and questioning Jankor's lies), and the eager Jancan smith Steros \u2013 you prepared to leave the smoldering fortress. A brief, unsettling encounter with the ancient, blind cyclops Polyphorus in his opulent chambers ended with you wisely declining his ominous arm-wrestling challenge after a quick consult with Steros.  </p> <p>With the fortress explored and its treasures secured (including Jankor's secret lockbox ), you emerged into the jungle, guided back to the Bloodscale village. Queen Vytha hailed your victory, declaring the spoils of the fortress yours by right. But more than treasure, she offered an ancient blessing. As dawn broke, amidst drumming and Sessith's Draconic chants, Queen Vytha performed the Ritual of the Volcano's Heart. Anointing each of you with a paste of ash, scales, and moss, she drew symbols that surged with intense heat before settling into your skin, granting you the permanent Blessing of the Volcano's Heart \u2013 newfound resilience against fire.  </p> <p>Returning to the Ultros, celebration mingled with new beginnings. Rhaena greeted Nissy, who returned bearing a gleaming Silver Dragon Egg! Delphi's expertise revealed both his Brass Egg and Rhaena's Silver Egg would hatch in a mere fifteen days. Steros set about finding space for his forge and tools, agreeing to help construct an incubator. Meanwhile, the contents of Jankor's hidden lockbox were examined: a journal written in Draconic, a Potion of Fire Breath, a potent Scroll of Lightning Bolt, valuable gems, a sinister Obsidian Sacrificial Dagger, a suspicious Potion of Storm Giant Strength seemingly tainted by Sydon, and a heavy, pulsating obsidian geode trapping a fiendish entity.  </p> <p>As you set sail, a Siren messenger delivered a crucial letter from Aesop, Keeper of the Dragon Shrine, revealing his suspicion that other ancient dragons might still live, captured by the Titans. Your journey then took you back to the wandering Jazirat Zul'Haf, the Turtle Island. There, you delivered the promised fire snake eggs to the delighted marid, Shazum. As reward, you chose the mysterious Orb of Star Metal. Shazum, ever the trader, tasked you with acquiring a Perfect Basilisk Eye from your next destination \u2013 Themis \u2013 offering a choice of magical items or gold in return. You bartered with him, selling the risky Sydon-touched potion and purchasing scrolls and the Crusher's Ring for Aella, while Delphi acquired an Elemental Mote.

Initial aerial scouting by Aella's Stimfay revealed herds of strange creatures, rhino riders, basilisk hounds, scattered war camps, and, ominously, a small island in the eastern bay covered in statue-like figures \u2013 the likely heart of the usurpers' power.  </p> <p>Now, standing on the shores of Themis, with allies at your side and enemies unknown lurking across the plains, your quest for allies and answers truly begins...

The island presented a chilling vista: a veritable forest of life-sized marble statues, the vast majority depicting beautiful, naked young men, alongside a grim collection of others, some scarred or maimed. At its heart, a grand marble staircase spiraled down into the earth, beckoning you towards the unknown.</p> <p>With Aella stepping onto her homeland after thirteen years of bitter exile, the air was thick with anticipation and the unspoken weight of her quest to reclaim her birthright. The party, including the knowledgeable warrior Makaira and the Jancan Steros\u2014hopeful of finding his captive father, Bront, within whatever lay below\u2014prepared to delve into the darkness. Delphi, ever cautious, invoked Pass Without Trace for the group, while Aella enhanced his agility with Longstrider.</p> <p>The first test came swiftly. As Delphi began his descent down the marble steps, intending to scout ahead with his re-summoned owl familiar, four of the stoic marble statues flanking the entrance ground to life, their stony silence replaced with hostile intent! A hasty retreat by Delphi caused the guardians to return to their inanimate repose. A chilling discovery followed: a chip Delphi had previously inflicted on a statue was observed to slowly regenerate, the marble magically mending itself.</p> <p>Further investigation revealed a crucial weakness: the golems remained inert when Aella, Rhaena, and Makaira approached, only animating to repel the men of the party, Astraeus and Delphi. While the women could pass, the problem of their male companions remained. Delphi's owl, ghosting past the sealed brass doors at the stairway's nadir, revealed two Amazon warriors within, seemingly at ease, playing cards.</p> <p>Aella dispatched her loyal Stimfay to circle the island's exterior, searching for alternative routes. The clockwork bird returned with two possibilities: a large, half-submerged stone culvert, and a narrow crack in the cliff face, currently at high tide, which might offer passage in a few hours.</p> <p>The party faced a choice: wait for the tide, attempt the culvert which might prove too small for Rhaena, or face the regenerating stone guardians head-on. Impatience and the desire for direct confrontation won out; the golems would be dealt with.</p> <p>Rhaena's initial attempt to topple a golem with ropes proved futile as she stumbled. The battle was joined! The party quickly learned the golem's resilience: they were immune to non-magical weaponry, Rhaena's mundane javelins bouncing harmlessly.

Astraeus's spells and enchanted arrows from the Shortbow of Cupid found their mark, while Delphi's magic blasted and hindered.</p> <p>The fight became a brutal dance of attrition. The golems struck hard, their marble fists and spear-like protrusions finding their targets, injuring Delphi and Makaira significantly. The key to victory lay in Rhaena's adamantine Nightblade, which carved grievous wounds in the constructs, bypassing their normal defenses and dealing devastating double damage.

The air was thick with the weight of Aella's thirteen-year exile, her quest to reclaim her birthright burning in her eyes.</p> <p>Aella, ever the keen-eyed leader, discerned the secret of the massive bronze door: a rotating mechanism bearing a hand-shaped imprint, a silent invitation to the brave. Through it, you descended into the earth, the pressure building in your ears with each spiraling step.</p> <p>You emerged into a cavernous chamber, the air thick with the musky scent of reptiles. Here, two Amazon warriors stood guard, one methodically sharpening a cleaver, the other pacing. Behind bronze bars, enormous eight-legged basilisks rumbled contentedly, their reptilian eyes a chilling promise of petrification. After a quick respite to recover your strength, you decided against stealth, opting for a decisive strike. Astraeus, with his enchanting charisma, charmed one of the Amazon guards, Talia, turning her heart to his cause. The battle was swift and brutal; Aella, with her enchanted chakram, cut down the dwarf basilisk-keeper Nura and her companion. The monstrous basilisks, now neutralized under hastily thrown sailcloth, snarled in frustration.</p> <p>With Talia charmed and bound, you extracted crucial intelligence. You learned of Commander Lyra, Queen Thesilea VI, and her sister Leia\u2014all dwelling deeper within the complex. You discovered the existence of other prisoners: captured lizardfolk, the giant Jancan blacksmith Bront (Steros's father!), and most importantly, Darien, a childhood friend of Aella's and a high-ranking loyalist to the true queen, imprisoned for thirteen years. Talia also divulged the dark truth behind the marble statues outside: they are the petrified \"favored sons of Lutheria,\" some born here, some shipwrecked, some gifts from afar, and some destined as fodder for the basilisks. You also learned of an underwater entrance, though its exact location remained a mystery. The fallen Amazon warriors were disposed of, tossed over the cliff, their bodies carried away by the waves, unwittingly taking vital keys with them.</p> <p>Leaving the lovestruck Talia (gagged and bound to prevent her alerting anyone to your presence) behind, you proceeded deeper. The next bronze door proved a stubborn challenge, its lock resisting Aella's initial attempts. Even with Stimfay sent to scour the cliff face for Nura's discarded keys (a futile search), Aella's persistent lockpicking eventually yielded.</p> <p>Beyond, a honeycomb-like tunnel reeked of stagnant water. Your heightened senses detected a subtle trap plate. As Aella cautiously investigated, thick, serpentine hydra heads erupted from the holes in the walls, snapping venomously! Aella narrowly evaded their lethal bites. Realizing the danger, Astraeus raced back to Talia, charming her once more to glean the password: \"By the Grace of Lutheria.\" Whispering the blasphemous phrase, you felt a chilling resonance of Lutheria's power, a sickening echo of past nightmares, but the monstrous heads retreated, allowing passage.</p> <p>Navigating around more hidden trap plates, you discovered a side passage leading to the Amazon Barracks. Astraeus, peeking in, confirmed two more Amazon warriors inside, idly playing cards. Without hesitation, you burst in. Rhaena's longsword carved down one warrior, while Aella's chakram, in a brutal arc, decapitated the other. Among the spoils, you found a necklace heavy with keys!</p> <p>These keys opened the final, formidable door in the barracks, revealing a grim sight: a hallway lined with prison cells. Two lizardfolk prisoners pleaded for rescue, revealing their loyalty to Queen Vytha and mentioning the cyclops Bront's capture.</p> <p>But the true revelation lay in the last cell: a young woman, scarred and silent. Recalling Talia's earlier mention of a high-ranking loyalist named Darien held prisoner for her allegiance to the true queen, Aella addressed the unresponsive figure. Despite Aella's impassioned revelation of her own true identity and her denouncement of the medusa usurpers' treachery, the woman remained eerily silent. Delphi, however, with his keen senses, noticed a peculiar acoustic anomaly in her cell, a subtle disturbance suggesting a magical silence was at play. With a final turn of a hard-won key, Aella opened Darien's cell. As the iron grated open, the young woman finally looked up, her eyes wide with a mixture of nervousness and fear.</p>"},{"location":"friday/recaps/recap_session_29.html","title":"Session 29","text":"<p>Alright heroes, gather 'round and let's relive the blood, stone, and secrets from our last descent into the serpent's den!</p> <p>Our session began in the grim aftermath of your brutal takedown of the Amazonian guards. The iron door of a magically-silenced cell grated open, and a name, long thought lost to treachery, was whispered in the dark: Darian. With the rescue of Aella's childhood friend and cousin-in-spirit, your infiltration transformed into the first true strike to reclaim a stolen throne. After freeing the captive lizardfolk, Skal and Veth, you cleverly turned the enemy's prison against them, silencing the charmed Amazon guard Talia within the very cell that had held Darian for thirteen long years.</p> <p>While looting the barracks, you uncovered a trove of treasure and strange curiosities: adamantine daggers, platinum pieces, a sailor's map hinting at dangers on other isles, and a grim necklace made from a single, gnarled fingernail. After arming the vengeful Darian with the weapons of her former captors and healing her wounds with bitter wine and potions, you prepared to delve deeper into the usurper's lair.</p> <p>The path downward led past a mesmerizing, cobalt-glowing fountain.

A demon of trouble and boredom, she was amused by your quest for revenge and offered a poisoned chalice of information, pointing you toward the bedchamber of Leia, one of the medusa usurpers.</p> <p>Following her directions past a hidden trap plate, you arrived at a gilded door. Inside, a scene of cloying decadence: Leia, clad in silk, lounging on a bed with a powerful minotaur, serenaded by the maenad musician you now hold prisoner. The unsettling cries of infants echoed from a cradle in the corner.</p> <p>The ambush was perfect. You burst in with the fury of a storm, Aella's chakram screaming for vengeance as it found its mark on Leia. Astraeus bathed the room in Faerie Fire, Rhaena's spear skewered the minotaur, and Delphi's magic tore through the chamber. But your triumph was cut short by a horrifying turn. As the battle was joined, Leia unleashed her petrifying gaze. In a heartbeat, Astraeus and Delphi were turned to cold, unmoving stone! The \"infants\" in the cradle revealed their true form as goatling tricksters, one of whom transformed the mighty Makaira into a helpless rat.</p> <p>Just as disaster seemed imminent, Delphi, in his final moment of flesh and blood, unleashed a devastating, maximized bolt of lightning from a hard-won scroll.

His dramatic flair, razor wit, and reputation for scandal aren't weaknesses\u2014they're calculated assets. His flamboyant persona isn't just a personal preference, but a strategic mask\u2014a decoy and weapon forged for a singular purpose: To draw attention away from the house's real vulnerabilities. He wears silk and sarcasm like armor. While others plot in silence or strike in shadow, Velryss steps into the spotlight\u2014so others don't have to. This role isn't self-imposed. It was crafted under the eyes of his Aunt and Teacher, Matron Severine T'alzar, the house's ruthless and brilliant leader. She saw in Velryss not a soldier or priest, but a weapon of spectacle\u2014one that could shift attention, destabilize enemies, and protect the family's interests with words, illusions, and deadly grace. He honed this craft under her instruction, learning how to move through noble courts and violent alleys with equal poise. From dueling Sergeant Vex in a crowded square to intentionally starting a tavern brawl as a diversion, Velryss has embraced the role of the \"fool with a blade\"\u2014knowing full well it is all by design</p> <p>The Mask and What he brings to the Team</p> <p>He smiles while enemies underestimate him. He spins words and blades with equal grace. He makes you laugh while stealing your attention from something far more dangerous.</p> <p>\"They think I dance for attention. I dance so they don't see the knife. Or the spider behind it.</p> <p>Bladesinger in the House of Blades  While his peers pursued the divine path of Lolth, Velryss sought something more refined: Bladesinging\u2014a forbidden art among many conservative T\u2019alzar matriarchs for its association with old elven grace. He trained in secret, blending swordplay, illusions, and arcane performance into a style all his own.</p> <p>Velryss\u2019s key Relationships within House T\u2019Alzar</p> <p>Matron Severine T\u2019alzar: Matron Severine T\u2019alzar \u2013 The cold, calculating, and commanding Matron of House T\u2019alzar. She took Velryss under her wing as a political gamble\u2014and he became her most theatrical, volatile weapon. Their relationship is a rare mixture of unspoken respect and sharp utility. He will do anything not to disappoint her.</p> <p>Velryss was not chosen to lead armies or preach dogma. He was chosen to distract, dazzle, and disarm. Severine gave him the tools to become indispensable\u2014the house's noise, cover, and misdirection, used in places where subtlety alone might fail. Though her praise is rare, Velryss reads mountains into her silences.</p> <p>Miraleh T\u2019alzar: The one he\u2019d Bleed for  Miraleth T\u2019alzar \u2013 young and gentle-hearted. Miraleth is the only one who speaks to Velryss without fear, flattery, or formality. She sees through his mask  and accepts him anyway. He is fiercely protective of her, especially now that her father, Valandor, has gone missing. </p> <p>The only family member he's ever been truly himself with. Her presence is a reminder of what He Fights for in House T\u2019alzar.</p> <p>Valandor - THe missing Genius:  Valandor T\u2019alzar \u2013 Despite clashing personalities\u2014Valandor, the reclusive artificer; Velryss, the flamboyant duelist\u2014the two shared rare moments of quiet respect. They occasionally discussed theory over wine and firelight, sparring with ideas rather than blades. </p> <p>Velryss respected Valandor\u2019s intellect and deeply valued his insights, even if the older drow's stoicism grated against his flair. Their late-night debates created a quiet kinship built on intellect and unspoken loyalty.</p> <p>Valandor\u2019s disappearance struck Velryss more deeply than he admits. Beneath the sarcasm and silk, Velryss feels the absence like a silenced melody. His commitment to the family\u2019s mission hides a deeper resolve: to bring Valandor home, not just for the House, but because some part of Velryss refuses to let brilliance fade without a fight. </p> <p>Lirael T\u2019Alzar-  The mirror in Shadow: Lirael T'alzar \u2013 Where Velryss is flamboyance, Lirael is restraint. Where he speaks in Silk and flourishes, she carves with silence and subtlety. She isn't his formal mentor\u2014but Velryss sees her as a measure of what he could become if he could master stillness. He deeply respects her intellect, and though he would mock her coldness publicly, he often models his deeper tactics after her unseen hand.</p> <p>Vyssinia T\u2019alzar- The Blade AT his Back:  Vyssinia T'alzar \u2013 Devoted to Lolth and direct action, Vyssinia and Velryss rarely agree\u2014but they undeniably complement each other. Her brute force gives weight to his illusions, and his charm gives softness to her fearsome presence. He annoys her. She frightens him. Together, they protect the House in ways neither fully admits.</p>"},{"location":"monday/players/character_dossiers/zyntra.html","title":"Zyntra","text":"<p>House T'alzar Character Development Worksheet</p> <p>This worksheet will help you create a compelling character with traits you can actively use in roleplaying.</p> <p>1.

Your infiltration plan, a daring underwater approach, was initiated. Haribo, shrouded in invisibility and transformed into a bat, scouted ahead.</p> <p>Your aerial reconnaissance revealed the grim heart of duergar industry. At the docks, you saw a slow duergar barge, a drow yacht, and, ominously, Valandor's own speedboat, the Night-Talon . Inside the foundry's main level, you glimpsed off-duty workers and, more disturbing, the gruesome assembly of ** Screamers**, with duergar being forced into metallic suits by a grim priest and master smith. You even overheard workers grumbling about Valandor, referring to him as \"the drow prisoner, the artificer,\" and hinting that \"they finally broke the prisoner today\". The Peepers, the foundry's anti-invisibility constructs, also lurked, a threat to your stealth.</p> <p>Descending to the moonpool, you surfaced in a warm, humid cavern, the thrumming of the massive turbine deafening. Your first target: a deceptively cozy cottage on the sub-level. Bentham, still in his natural form, led the way, ambushing Alyxina Fire-Beard ** , the researcher's wife, as she cooked. After a brief interrogation, Malagar, with brutal efficiency, slit her throat** , and Bentham dragged the body into a nearby storage room, which was then looted for supplies and spare parts. Haribo, meanwhile, befriended Alyxina's pet cave spider, Skitter, by offering it fresh rat blood.</p> <p>Next, you moved to the upper level of the cottage, where Chief Researcher Korvun worked in his study. Bentham, now shape-shifted into Alyxina's form, attempted a deception, introducing the party as \"college friends\". Though Korvun was suspicious, the ruse held long enough for the ambush. Ramon paralyzed him with Hold Person, and Haribo poisoned him with spores. While Zyntra accidentally triggered an alarm by failing to disarm a trap on a locked chest, Korvun, under duress, finally revealed the location of Valandor: imprisoned upstairs, behind a heavy adamantine door ** requiring special \"rods of unlocking\" held by the three foundry bosses. As the information was extracted, Zyntra disarmed the alarm and the chest's gas trap. With a final, chilling act, Bentham ** executed Korvun, delivering a parting taunt about his murdered wife.</p> <p>From Korvun's hidden chest, you secured invaluable finds: three D\u00fbmril Ingots ** (Black Mithril) stamped with the ancient Auldbaern symbol, proving their origin in the royal catacombs; a ** Prototype Resonance Lens , capable of detecting thoughts; and a damning letter from ** Director Koldar** (sealed with House Glutthraz wax) demanding increased Screamer output, confirming your rivals' deep involvement. You also found a manual on \"Transmutation\" and a note hinting at the \"Deep-Spire map\" for the true source of D\u00fbmril.</p> <p>With Korvun and Alyxina silenced, the truth of Valandor's fate is clearer than ever: he is alive, albeit imprisoned, and his research is central to the horrific Screamer project. You now possess the means to potentially stop this grim production, armed with critical intelligence and samples of the very Black Mithril that fuels the duergar's monstrous creations. The stage is set for the next phase of your infiltration, with Valandor's rescue, and vengeance, within your grasp.</p>"},{"location":"monday/recaps/recap_session_3.html#_1","title":"Session 3","text":""},{"location":"monday/recaps/recap_session_4.html","title":"Session 4","text":""},{"location":"monday/recaps/recap_session_4.html#session-4-recap","title":"Session 4 Recap","text":"<p>When last we left our ruthless agents of House T'alzar, you had drawn first blood in the Cinderfork Foundry, silencing the researchers in their own home. But the sub-level was far from secure, its halls still echoing with the clang of machinery and the tread of duergar boots. What followed was not a battle, but a systematic, chilling purge.</p> <p>Your cottage became a slaughterhouse disguised as a sanctuary. One by one, you lured the foundry's personnel to their doom. First, the unsuspecting guard, Borland Emberback , drawn in by Bentham's flawless imitation of the now-dead Alyxina crying \"fire!\" He walked into a dark kitchen and was met not with smoke, but with a waiting storm of steel. His death was swift, his keys now yours.</p> <p>With calculated precision, you turned this trick into a gruesome production line. Rav'ithar, cloaked in the shadow of the fallen guard, became the new gatekeeper. He beckoned another worker, Heldrick ** , with promises of a secret stash of rum, leading him into the same fatal ambush. Then came the formidable Stone Guard, Corgrim Smelt-Eye** , a warrior lured to his death by the lie that his subordinates were slacking off inside. He, too, fell to your coordinated assault.</p> <p>Your quiet butchery was nearly exposed by the arrival of \"Peepers,\" the foundry's all-seeing Scrutinizer. As the construct floated towards the cottage, its alarm ready to sound, you sprung a new trap. A globe of absolute silence enveloped the cottage, swallowing all sound. As the machine entered the unnatural quiet, the very ground erupted in grasping vines, entangling and holding it fast. You descended upon the helpless machine, tearing it apart and ensuring your infiltration remained a secret.</p> <p>With the ground floor secured, knowledge became your weapon. Rav'ithar, having consumed the researcher Korvun's memories, saw the foundry's inner workings laid bare in his mind. He now understood the layout, the chain of command, and the agonizing secret at the facility's heart: a mighty Geothermal Elemental , caged and tormented to power the forges.</p> <p>Assuming the forms of your victims, you ascended to the mezzanine, a catwalk overlooking the foundry floor. You became ghosts in the machine, your disguises perfect, your purpose lethal. An officious inspector named Kelzar was the first to fall, tricked into a secluded stairwell where his authority meant nothing against your blades. His own workers were sent to their deaths moments later, commanded to \"assist\" his corpse. One by one, you cleared the upper level, tricking and executing the remaining duergar hammerers, your movements a ballet of deception and death. The bodies piled up, hidden away in the dark, as you looted the workshops, claiming valuable crystals and unrefined mithril, the very substance you came for.</p> <p>Your only wild card came in the form of Og , a hulking Quaggoth who approached the guard post seeking a salve for a chemical burn. Bentham, still playing the role of the guard, masterfully deflected the beast's questions, sending him away confused but alive, your cover intact.</p> <p>And so, we find you now, masters of a silent fortress. The entire sub-level and its overlooking mezzanine are under your control, the bodies of your enemies stuffed into closets and crates. You stand in the heart of the enemy's operation, a mountain of corpses behind you and a wealth of intelligence in your hands. But your path forward is blocked by a colossal, roaring turbine, spinning with deadly speed. Before you lies a choice: do you risk manipulating the complex machinery to grant you passage, or do you dare to unleash the raging, imprisoned elemental and ride the wave of chaos that follows?

You targeted the Gear Room, the control hub for the deadly machine. Ravi, cloaked in the guise of the slain Chief Researcher, and Malagar, disguised as a common guard, confronted the lone worker inside. Through clever deception, you learned the secrets of the levers\u2014how to divert the steam, and more importantly, how to trigger a full system shutdown. The worker, having outlived his usefulness, was executed with cold precision, his body added to the growing pile.</p> <p>With the controls understood, you set your sights on a greater prize: Chief Engineer Tholdrum , who you believed held one of the three keys to Valandor\u2019s prison.

Enraged, he overcharged his massive steam hammer and, in a single, furious assault, crushed Ravi, leaving him on the brink of death.</p> <p>It was a desperate fight.

One by one, you leaped through the slowing, superheated blades, phantom shapes crossing into the dark.</p> <p>You ascended. The next level was a mess hall, echoing with the drunken laughter of off-duty Duergar. But a higher staircase beckoned, and what you saw there froze the blood.

You made the cold, tactical decision to retreat, to purge the foundry from the bottom up. In the stairwell, you began to weave a web of death, rigging grenades to tripwires. Your work was interrupted by the approach of two guards. But chaos is your ally. Bentham, a vision of the murdered Alyxina, stalked up the stairs, hissing lies and orders that sent the confused guards right into Malaggar's waiting blades. A flash of steel in the dark, and two more bodies were silently pitched into the abyss below. The trap was set.</p> <p>Then, you unleashed hell on the mess hall.</p> <p>A bubble of absolute silence plunged the room into a deafening void. Vicious thorns erupted from the floor, sealing the elevator into a deathtrap. Before the Duergar could even comprehend the silent chaos, you descended upon them. Zyntra's dagger blazed with green fire, turning one guard to ash. Malaggar was a blur of motion, his Dread Ambusher strikes felling two more before they could even rise from their card game. Bentham was a phantom, his blade appearing from the shadows to deliver an automatic, critical blow that erased a guard captain from existence.</p> <p>The room became a charnel house. You were a symphony of slaughter, moving from target to target, your blades and bolts finding every weakness.

One by one they fell, until the only sounds were the thud of your own heartbeats in the unnatural quiet.</p> <p>The silence is yours. The floor is yours. The bodies are stacked and cooling.

The mess hall was a charnel house, its former occupants cooling in pools of their own blood. Then the unnatural quiet was violently broken by thunder from above\u2014three massive explosions as your trap detonated in the stairwell, shaking Cinderfork Foundry to its very foundations. Your perfectly placed grenades had found a structural weakness, and tons of stone and metal came crashing down, sealing the main stairs in an avalanche of rubble. Whatever forces had triggered your trap were now entombed in their own fortress.</p> <p>With the foundry seemingly deaf to your rampage, you seized the moment to plunder and explore. First, you examined the adamantine door to Valandor's cell\u2014its surface crawling with glowing, pulsating runes that promised magical retribution to any who dared breach it without the proper keys. Your systematic search became a tapestry of grim discovery. Behind a faded tapestry of ancient Auldbaern, Clank deciphered a desperate warning scrawled in Dwarvish: \"The Screamers' wails are worse now. That black stuff's cursed, I tell you.\" In the kitchen, Rav'ithar identified the stupor afflicting two cooks as the work of distilled Peep's Slumber Fungus. Malaggar's blade ended one's chemical journey permanently, while the other was bound for later questioning.</p> <p>But treachery lurked even in rest. As Zyntra searched the guards' quarters, a poisoned needle trap hidden in a torn mattress struck her down, her drow constitution failing against a toxin designed to shut down respiratory systems. Only Haribo's quick thinking saved her, the myconid forcing his own spores down her throat in a desperate bid to counteract the poison.</p> <p>The prize for that near-death experience? A blood-stained journal belonging to Tharn Deep-Spire\u2014a voice from the grave revealing the terrifying truth. The Black Mithril, the D\u00fbmril, becomes psychically unstable without proper dwarven purification rituals. The drow, ignorant of this requirement, were creating weapons of madness. Page after page detailed not only the alchemical formula to cleanse the corruption\u2014requiring holy water, powdered sapphire, and drow blood\u2014but darker revelations: House Glutthraz has infiltrated Clan Fire-Beard with a spy, seeking the \"binding code\" to control ancient vaults sealed beneath Cairnhollow Isle, marked by a lone lighthouse. Most chilling of all, the journal's final entry was a direct plea to Valandor\u2014your rescue target\u2014from a fellow scientist who saw the coming disaster.</p> <p>Your exploration led to a latrine door marked with dire warnings. From the bubbling filth erupted a nightmare\u2014an Otyugh twisted by foundry runoff, its hide embedded with the same black metal veins as the Screamers. Yet where others would see only a monster, you saw opportunity. Through Malaggar's druidic diplomacy and Haribo's healing touch, you soothed the creature's black mithril sores. The grateful beast, calling itself Autiog, became an unlikely ally, sharing precious intelligence: secret tunnels beneath the forge floor, drow who enter during \"peak fire time\" and never return, and a high priest in a bright hat whose rituals are strongest when the forges burn hottest.</p> <p>As Autiog pointed a tentacle toward a maze of foul-smelling pipes leading upward, its words were drowned by a deafening roar. The floor of the cold storeroom exploded in a shower of stone and splintered barrels as your cantankerous ally Grumble burst through in his massive siege drill, complaining bitterly about the pickled eels he'd just ruined.</p> <p>And so you stand at a crossroads.

Andrew and Kain publicly challenged the cult's motives and connection to Sydon's storm. This caused unrest among the citizens and led the cultists to abandon their post and supplies.  </li> <li>Wine Barrel Clue: Investigated the abandoned wine barrel and identified it (via Tharok's knowledge) as bearing the official seal of the Lutherian wine cartel.  </li> <li>Wine Warehouse Arrival: Reached the wine warehouse. Initial attempts at deception by Kain (disguised as a cultist) were unsuccessful.  </li> <li>Information Gathering: Overheard workmen discussing The Siren's Roost brothel and its expensive \"companions\" (including one claiming to be daughter of a Nereid). Kain and Nicandros used this to befriend the workmen with fake coupons, learning about their supervisor, Epimelites Malachor.  </li> <li>Meeting with Malachor: Spoke with Epimelites Malachor, the warehouse supervisor.  </li> <li>Warehouse Cargo: Learned that the warehouse transports not just wine, but also \"new converts,\" \"slaves,\" and \"kidnapped children.\"  </li> <li>The Ledger: Gained access to and stole Malachor's ledger (Tharok, with Rhy-At's help). The ledger shows a cyclical pattern of shipments of \"small casks,\" indicating they are frequently delivered to the main Temple of Lutheria. This reinforces the suspicion that children are being transported in these casks.  </li> <li>Colossus of Pythor: Decided to investigate the Colossus of Pythor. Found a heavily locked door at the base.  </li> <li>Breaking In: Used a combination of immense strength (Tharok and Zephyrion, now Large size with increased Strength), lockpicking attempts (Kain), and magical force (Andrew's Eldritch Blast) to break open the reinforced door.  </li> <li>Guardian Golems: Encountered two marble golems guarding the entrance. Discovered they can reassemble themselves after being destroyed. Attempted to delay reassembly by scattering their pieces.  </li> <li>Lady of Coins' Minions: Entered the Colossus and encountered several minotaurs and a gladiator lady, who identified themselves as serving the Lady of Coins (their target for Lord Taran's bounty).  </li> <li>Combat Initiated: Combat began after attempts at parley failed and the party used a blinding flash (Andrew) on some of the enemies.  </li> <li>Combat Status: </li> <li>Riot used a spell to restrain two minotaurs.  </li> <li>The Minotaur Hero released green gas into the room, poisoning several party members (failed Constitution saves).  </li> <li>Nicandros Hasted Tharok and Zephyrion.  </li> <li>Kain, Tharok, and Andrew dealt significant damage, defeating one minotaur.  </li> <li>Zephyrion pursued the gladiator lady who fled upstairs, grappling her and throwing her back down the stairs, dealing damage.  </li> <li>The gladiator lady is wounded but still mobile and has escaped further up the staircase.  </li> <li>Combat is ongoing.</li> </ul> <p>The session concluded mid-fight inside the Colossus of Pythor.

Rhy-At recalled that Queen Vallus's water treatment operations were down here and had been experiencing issues since the hurricane.  </li> <li>Kain scouted east, noticing a large shape moving under the deeper water which disappeared quickly. He failed to track it. He also spotted small, tentacle-like larval growths burrowed into the walls, which reacted to his presence. Andrew Lynx used Acid Splash to clear these growths.    </li> <li>Kain scouted further east and observed a giant rat being snatched by a large tentacle/limb from the water. He also spotted more larval growths.    </li> <li>The party engaged and killed a large tentacled creature (Otyugh?) that emerged. They decided against harvesting the carcass.  </li> <li>Kain scouted again, finding a sewer exit leading to the Mytros shipyards near the docks, but not near the Moist Maiden's usual berth.

The water level began to gradually decrease.  </li> <li>The party noted claw marks on the sluice gate and a large, damaged sewer pipe in the chamber.  </li> <li>Rhy-At contemplated an \"acid wash\" of the room, a task reminiscent of his temple duties, but the party decided to wait for the water to drain.  </li> <li>Kain scouted through a sluice gate, discovering an area with tiered water levels, and encountered a Grick creature, remaining undetected due to his invisibility. The party later engaged and killed this Grick.  </li> <li>There was discussion and manipulation of multiple sluice gates to control water flow, aiming to make areas traversable or expose hidden threats.  </li> <li> <p>The Organ and the Beast:</p> </li> <li> <p>The party discovered a chamber with an ornate organ.  </p> </li> <li>Tharok began to play the organ.

It gives +2 AC, +1 spell save DC, +1 spell attack rolls, and 1d6 hit points on successful saving throws against spells. It requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard.  </li> <li>The Wand of Switch Step allows for instantaneous position exchange of allies/enemies. It has 1d4 charges, regains 1d4 at dawn, and has a 1 in 20 chance to vanish if all charges are expended.  </li> <li>The Tome of Harmonious Thought gives +1 to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma (permanently, once per 100 years per person).  </li> </ul> </li> <li>They initially chose the Robe of the Weave and the Wand of Switch Step. Nikandros expressed interest in the Robe of the Weave due to its healing on saving throws. The party decided the Wand of Switch Step would be good for Nikandros due to its action cost and battlefield control.  </li> <li>The Queen also subtly warned them not to bring the Ultros (the ancestor's ship) back to her husband, King Acastus, as he has other plans and is trying to use them. Andrew Lynx knew Astor Archelander (King Acastus's ancestor) was a bloodthirsty dragon lord.  </li> <li>Hero's Feast and Shopping Spree: </li> <li>The party decided to take a long rest and eat dinner at the palace, which granted them the benefits of a Hero's Feast.  </li> <li>The Hero's Feast cured diseases (like Tharok's sewer plague), granted immunity to poison and frightened conditions for 24 hours, advantage on Wisdom saving throws, and an increase in hit point maximum by 2d10 (Tharok rolled 15 extra HP).  </li> <li>After the feast, they went to the dive bar (Satyrs' Tail) where Tharok had previously arm-wrestled.  </li> <li>Tharok bought drinks for everyone (20 gold).  </li> <li>Zephyrion flirted with the satyr-human hybrid barmaid, Lyra.  </li> <li>Tharok challenged the minotaur (whom he previously defeated) to a drinking contest. The minotaur was \"cowed\" and agreed to a friendly wager of 5 gold pieces.  </li> <li>Nikandros played his harp (borrowing Tharok's magical instrument) and conjured squirrels to re-enact their sewer fight, impressing the crowd and earning 50 gold pieces.  </li> <li>Kain (the spy) met with his contact, Sari the Knight, at the bar. Sari provided three rumors for 50 gold pieces each (total 150 gp):  <ul> <li>Queen Thessalia wears a full helm because no one may look on her divine beauty.  </li> <li>A hidden bay on the east coast of the Isle of Themis is choked with rocks, but an underwater tunnel leads to it.  </li> <li>The Amazons have mutated and trained a giant hydra to guard their underground lair, devouring anyone who enters.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>They then went to Talia's shop for supplies.  </li> <li>Tharok signed a potion for Talia as an \"endorsement\".  </li> <li>They tried to sell monster parts (cobold eggs, maw teeth). Tharok gave two kobold eggs to Vulcan and Pyra as gifts for future apprentices, keeping one for himself.  </li> <li>They purchased:  <ul> <li>Two Superior Healing Potions for each of the 6 party members (12 total), at a discounted price due to Talia's appreciation for their fame. Initial price 330 gp each, total 3960 gp.  </li> <li>Elixirs of Health (300 gp each, cures diseases/conditions). They bought two, making the total spend 3960 + 600 \\= 4560 gp.  </li> <li>One Oil of Sharpness (320 gp).  </li> <li>Five Potions of Heroism (one for each except Tharok).  </li> </ul> </li> <li>They sold various items:  <ul> <li>Silver ring (Coil of the Eternal Serpent) for 100 gold. This ring provides 1d6 poison damage on piercing/slashing attacks, advantage on saves vs. poison, a bonus action to coat weapon for 2d6 extra damage on next hit (once per short rest), and allows speaking with snakes/serpentine creatures. It requires attunement.  </li> <li>Fine jade figurine for 275 gold (negotiated up from 200).  </li> <li>Finely crafted music box for 250 gold. It casts Soothing Lullaby (Calm Emotions) once per day.  </li> <li>Six Hematite Spheres for 900 gold (150 each).  </li> <li>Mithril Short Sword +1 and Scale Mail Armor with serpent. These were likely sold, though specific prices aren't immediately clear from the transcript.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>They opted to keep the Scarab of Protection in party loot (provides +1 to all saves, advantage on saves vs. spells, 12 charges to force succeed on necromancy/undead effects).  </li> <li>Travel to the Mithril Forge and New Revelations: </li> <li>The party decided to go directly to the Mithril Forge, delaying the Ultros quest.  </li> <li>They chose to travel on The Swift Dawn with Captain Ione Stormwind for 225 gold (negotiated down from 240, after initially being 120 and then 240 to increase speed). Nikandros playing his harp allowed them to get 7 mph speed.  </li> <li>The travel took 4 hours.  </li> <li>They arrived at the Mithril Forge around 2 PM.  </li> <li>Mage Hand was used to pull the lever and open the waterfall entrance.  </li> <li>At the forge, Pyra and Vulcan had been doing remodeling.  </li> <li>Pyra presented them with the Cloak of Magic Immunity as their first commission. This cloak allows the wearer to spend charges (equal to spell's level) as a reaction to become immune to a spell's effects, regaining all charges daily.  </li> <li>Vulcan revealed a Calydonian , a messenger construct from the old days, found during clearing ruins.  </li> <li>To repair the Calydonian, Vulcan needs two Mithril ingots and 1000 gold pieces.  </li> <li>The party immediately provided the Mithril (from a Mithril-inlaid axe and other Mithril items) and the 1000 gold pieces. Once repaired (in 3 days), the Calydonian can deliver commissioned items and collected materials directly to the party anywhere, saving travel time.  </li> <li>Vulcan also presented Tharok with a Baby Basilisk companion (named \"Baby Bjorn\" or \"Bjorn\" after Tharok's axe), which will grow over time with feeding and care. It's a small creature that starts with a PB of 2.  </li> <li>Tharok also decided to give two of his kobold eggs to Vulcan and Pyra as gifts, for them to raise as apprentices. He kept one for himself.  </li> <li>The Wyvern egg they possess is expected to hatch in about 5 days.</li> </ol> <p>Current Status of the Party:</p> <ul> <li>Healed from Sewer Plague.  </li> <li>Received two powerful magic items: Robe of the Weave (Nikandros) and Wand of Switch Step.  </li> <li>Received the Cloak of Magic Immunity.  </li> <li>Commissioned the repair of the Calydonian messenger construct, providing the materials.  </li> <li>Tharok has a new baby basilisk companion (Baby Bjorn).  </li> <li>They are well-stocked with healing potions, elixirs of health, and potions of heroism.  </li> <li>They are currently at the Mithril Forge.  </li> <li>Their next major decision is whether to immediately pursue the Ultros (as Queen Vallus secretly instructed) or return to Sour Vintage for more rumors (as she publicly suggested) before going for the ship..

You also discovered four mysterious potions with potent but bizarre side effects.  </li> <li>After a short rest, you decided to deal with the remaining two \"traitorous\" thanes. You first sought out Metron, the Navigator, in the Thanes' Quarters.  </li> <li>You struck a deal with Metron: in exchange for his help to defeat Captain Estor, you would free the crew from their servitude within a maximum of five years and protect an ornate, magically sealed box in his quarters.  </li> <li>You then spoke with Davos, the Quartermaster, on the top deck. He agreed to the same terms, contingent on getting support from the other thanes. With Metron's oath secured, Davos pledged his and the crew's support, promising to keep the spectral rowers from joining Estor in the coming fight.  </li> <li>Between negotiations, Kain communicated with Delphia, the dryad spirit bound to the ship's mast. She warned, \"He must be defeated thrice,\" before vanishing.  </li> <li>The Battle for the Ultros - Round 1: </li> <li>With the thanes on your side, you prepared for the final confrontation. Zephyrion and Tharok drank powerful potions, growing to immense size, while Andrew Lynx drank a potion that shrunk him.  </li> <li>As you approached Estor Arkelander, he taunted Kyra, provoking her to anger. The battle began as Estor attempted to cast a spell, which was immediately thwarted by a series of counterspells from Rhy-At and Andrew Lynx.  </li> <li>Zephyrion and Tharok, empowered by haste and their giant forms, unleashed a devastating barrage of attacks, grievously wounding Estor.  </li> <li>In retaliation, Estor cast Fear on the two behemoths, causing Tharok to drop his axe and flee in terror.  </li> <li>Despite the fear, the party pressed the attack. A final, powerful Eldritch Blast from Andrew Lynx struck Estor, causing his form to dissolve into ashes.  </li> <li>The Battle for the Ultros - Round 2: </li> <li>As you stood over Estor's remains, Delphia warned that he was not truly gone. A purple meteor suddenly streaked from the sky, crashing onto the deck and exploding in a psychic fireball.  </li> <li>From the impact crater, a Giant Skeleton wreathed in psychic energy arose\u2014Estor's second form.  </li> <li>The battle raged anew. Kyra, enraged, unleashed a powerful lightning bolt from her wand, which was absorbed by Tharok's axe, supercharging it with electrical energy.  </li> <li>Tharok, now recovered from his fear, landed a massive blow, discharging the stored lightning and dealing immense damage.  </li> <li>Zephyrion followed up with a flurry of attacks, shattering the skeletal form and ending the second phase of the fight.  </li> <li>The Battle for the Ultros - Round 3: </li> <li>As the skeleton crumbled, the temperature on the ship plummeted, and frost covered every surface. A blood-red moon rose rapidly in the sky, casting a beam onto the deck from which Estor's final, Ghostly Apparition emerged.  </li> <li>The ghost proved to be Estor's most dangerous form. After weathering another onslaught of attacks, he vanished and successfully possessed Tharok.  </li> <li>Kyra immediately identified the possession. Andrew Lynx and Zephyrion, faced with attacking their friend, focused their fire on the possessed Tharok, eventually knocking him unconscious and forcing Estor's spirit out.  </li> <li>Now visible again, Estor was quickly overwhelmed. Zephyrion, wielding a flaming kopis, stabbed the ghost repeatedly, finally destroying the spectral captain for good.  </li> <li>Aftermath and Next Steps: </li> <li>With Estor Arkelander truly defeated, the spirit of Delphia was freed from the mast. She revived the fallen Tharok, kissing him on the cheek and breathing life back into him.  </li> <li>The party now has control of the Ultros. You must decide on a new captain and what to do with the spectral crew.  </li> <li>Your next destination was determined: you will sail for the Isle of the Lotus Witch, known for its giant scorpions and as a training ground for Origen warriors.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"wednesday/logs/log_session_31.html","title":"Session 31","text":"<p># Session 31 Quest Log (07/23/2025)</p>"},{"location":"wednesday/logs/log_session_31.html#command-of-the-ultros","title":"Command of the Ultros","text":"<ul> <li>Following the defeat of Estor, the party deliberates on who should captain the Ultros.</li> <li>Kain accepts the captaincy, swearing an oath to the ship's spirit, Delphia.

You must recover it from the goatlings and Demetria in the Mossy Temple if you hope to complete this ritual of guidance and power.  </li> <li>The Sacrifice at the Rock of Estor:   In a desperate gamble to save Princess Anora, you've struck a deal to sacrifice yourselves in her stead. The full moon looms only five days away. You must decide how to survive this ordeal\u2014whether by outwitting your foes, preparing clever defenses, or finding a way to break this dark bargain without dooming the city.  </li> <li>Recovering the Horn of Balmytria:   Without this relic, many blessings and rituals remain beyond your grasp. Its theft has forced a confrontation with the fey and their mistress, Demetria. Before you sail off to new islands or venture deeper into cursed caverns, you must restore the Horn to Estoria's shrine and fulfill your oaths. Log The Forest's Whispers </li> <li>The dense, ancient trees of the Oldwood loomed around you as Corinna led the way, her tear-streaked face filled with desperation. She spoke of children trapped within the Mossy Temple, ensnared by Demetria's wicked enchantments.  </li> <li>Zephyrion's decisive, though impulsive, blow against a goatling sent a clear message\u2014your party was not here for games. You were here to save lives. Secrets in the Shadows </li> <li>At the standing stones, the peculiar squirrel revealed itself.. Kain's magic brought communication, and Tharok's charisma earned the creature's trust, but Herkus's riddled words hinted at deeper horrors within the temple.  </li> <li>At last, the temple itself came into view, its towering marble pillars tangled with massive roots and coated in moss, as though nature itself sought to reclaim this cursed place. Trials in the Temple </li> <li>Battling through animate roots that sought to halt your progress, you pressed forward. Your clever use of stealth, spells, and teamwork saw you past the treacherous pool of swirling shapes, with Kalian's magic saving Zephyrion from the waters' ominous grasp.  </li> <li>The statues of Sydon demanded offerings. Coins and murmured prayers allowed safe passage, though the bitter taste of appeasement lingered as you descended deeper into the temple's heart. The Glade's Warnings </li> <li>In the ancient glade, you found a tormented boy, Sostrate, harried by cruel goatlings. Arrows flew, blades flashed, and Demetrius's mocking words seared their twisted hearts. Sostrate's rescue was swift and decisive, and Corinna's reunion with her friend brought a spark of hope amidst the gloom.  </li> <li>Strange plants revived your spirits, and a meeting with Melenthe, the friendly dryad, gifted you magical wine and dire warnings of Demetria's fall from grace. Even the fey were wary of the vengeful dryad's growing power. A Sinister Banquet </li> <li>You stumbled upon teenagers in a pink fungus-laden cavern, their minds dulled by enchanted bread, wine, and cheese. Zephyrion's sharp discipline broke their stupor, and together with Corinna, you convinced them to flee the temple's grasp.  </li> <li>The horrors of Demetria's domain deepened when you discovered goatlings cooking sinister meat in the kitchen\u2014dead children, victims of the dryad's dark rituals. The revulsion strengthened your resolve. A Final Confrontation </li> <li>At last, you entered Demetria's chambers. Her ritual was in full swing, with four teenage girls seated at a cursed feast. The plates held food that could transform them into monstrous maenads. With split-second decisions, Kain cast entangle, trapping Demetria, her gygan companion, and two of the girls.  </li> <li>Ari rushed forward, scattering the plates to save the innocent. Tharok and Zephyrion launched ferocious attacks, felling the gygan with heroic blows. Meanwhile, Kalian unleashed radiant magic, and Demetrius's vicious whispers unraveled Demetria's composure.  </li> <li>Facing the might of your combined strength, Demetria surrendered, offering a potion to reverse the maenads' transformation and swearing to change her ways. Her hatred for Estor Arkelander burned deep, and Ari shared her vow to one day slay the dragonlord who had wronged them both. Victory and Questions </li> <li>The Horn of Balmytria is yours! Its legendary power awaits, but so too does the question of Demetria's fate. Will you trust her promises of reform or take a harder path? Corinna and her rescued friends offer gratitude and speak of rewards waiting at her father's vineyard in Estoria.  </li> <li>Ahead lies the Mithral Forge, brimming with ancient potential, but the shadow of the full moon and the looming threat of Estor's Rock cast a dark pall over your triumphs.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"wednesday/logs/log_session_9.html","title":"Session 9","text":"<p>Epic Path Reminders</p> <ul> <li>Ariasia (\"Ari\"), The Lost One:   You've learned that the key to finding your way home lies in the lost treasure of the Dragonlords .

Rhy-At shielded himself with illusory duplicates while Tharok, fueled by rage and Nicandros's haste, relentlessly pressed the attack against the gas-releasing minotaur. Kain, though suffering the poison's effects, landed telling shots with his bow. Andrew Lynx's arcane blasts sought targets, while Zephyrion contended with the surprisingly resilient gladiator lady who had managed to break free from his crushing grapple, only to be struck down again by his swift reaction.</p> <p>Tharok's mighty axe finally silenced the Minotaur Hero, whose dying breath cursed you for slaying their \"savior.\" Facing the imposing minotaur alone, the remaining warrior, Kragnos, surrendered under Tharok's fierce intimidation. With the immediate threat subdued, Tharok closed the hissing valve, stopping the flow of poison, and Zephyrion quickly applied the Mithral Thread bandages purchased from Talia, miraculously purging the lingering poison from Kain's system. A quick search yielded coin, gems, and gear from the fallen foes, including a vial of noxious sludge Kragnos identified simply as \"shit.\" Tharok allowed the defeated minotaur to depart, warning him away.</p> <p>Pressing upwards, you passed through chambers filled with more strange machinery \u2013 an acidic-smelling torso room (C4) and a chest chamber (C5) housing a massive furnace heart. Here, thugs and other shady figures played cards, interrupting their game to eye your party warily. A watchful drow demanded a password, but Tharok, thinking quickly, bluffed passage by invoking Kragnos's name and mentioning a need to see \"Moxina\" about lucrative business, a gamble that surprisingly paid off.</p> <p>Ascending finally into the head of the Colossus (C6), you found yourselves in the lair of the Lady of Coins herself. The Medusa, Moxena, lounged amidst lifelike statues \u2013 her petrified victims \u2013 under the eerie glow of a central control orb. A tense negotiation began. Confronting her about her trafficking operations for the dragon Hexia and her ties to the Isle of Themis, Moxena revealed fragmented truths about her business and her exiled Amazonian sisters. Offers and counter-offers flew: her demand for Lord Neurdagon's head, your refusal, her offer to join your voyage if you helped her against her sisters. After much deliberation and a masterful persuasion by the party, a deal was struck. Moxena would cease her criminal activities in Mytros and aid you on your journey after you leave the city, meeting you via her contacts near the Satyr's Tail. In return, you agreed to help her confront her usurper sisters on Themis, leaving Lord Neurdagon out of the arrangement for now. Satisfied, she permitted you to leave, requesting only that you fix the door you destroyed on your way out.</p> <p>Before departing the Colossus entirely, you chose to investigate the alternate passage downward from the belly chamber \u2013 the Colossus's other leg. Descending a makeshift ladder, you entered the foul-smelling Mytros sewers. Rhy-At recalled this area housed the city's waterworks, known to be malfunctioning since Sydon's storm. Kain scouted ahead through the muck, spotting strange larval growths on the walls (which Andrew subsequently destroyed with Acid Splash) and glimpsing a large, unidentified creature moving beneath the murky water before it vanished. Moments later, a giant rat was snatched from the path by a massive tentacle-like limb erupting from the sludge. An Otyugh-like monstrosity emerged, which the party swiftly dispatched. Kain, scouting further, discovered a sewer exit leading directly to the Mytros shipyards, though not near the known berth of Varkon's Moist Maiden.</p> <p>Having cleared the Colossus and struck a precarious bargain with the Lady of Coins, you now stand at a crossroads within the stinking depths of the Mytros sewers, facing unknown paths, potential connections to the Temple of Lutheria, and the lingering presence of monstrous inhabitants...</p>"},{"location":"wednesday/recaps/recap_session_22.html","title":"Session 22 Recap:","text":""},{"location":"wednesday/recaps/recap_session_22.html#05072025","title":"05/07/2025","text":""},{"location":"wednesday/recaps/recap_session_22.html#dd-session-recap-from-colossus-to-cesspool-mayhem-in-the-mytros-sewers","title":"D\\&amp;D Session Recap: From Colossus to Cesspool \u2013 Mayhem in the Mytros Sewers!","text":"<p>Heroes of the Prophecy! Your daring infiltration of the Colossus of Pythor culminated in a tense bargain with Moxena, the Lady of Coins ** , leader of the Thieves' Guild known as the \"Cult of the Snake.\"** With an agreement struck to aid her against her sisters on Themis in exchange for her ceasing criminal operations in Mytros, you descended from the mechanical titan's leg into the stinking, malfunctioning sewers beneath the city \u2013 a realm Rhy-At knew housed the city's troubled waterworks. After a brief skirmish with an Otyugh-like horror, you pressed on into the unknown depths.</p> <p>The Descent into Foul Waters:</p> <p>Your sewer exploration quickly became a hands-on lesson in ancient plumbing. Cautiously approaching a sluice gate, Nicandros ** , with a clever use of Mage Hand, unleashed a torrent, gradually draining a vast chamber. Ominous claw marks on the gate hinted at unseen dangers. While Rhy-At** considered a full \"acid wash\" of the massive room (a familiar chore from his temple days!), the party opted to wait for the waters to recede.</p> <p>Investigations revealed a colossal, damaged sewer pipe. The ever-vigilant Kain scouted ahead through another sluice, navigating a treacherous system of tiered water levels. It was here, cloaked in invisibility, that he first sensed it \u2013 a \"Grick\" creature, sniffing the air but failing to pinpoint the hidden ranger.</p> <p>An Organ of Ill Omen and a Worm from the Depths:</p> <p>The dank tunnels eventually opened into a chamber dominated by a peculiar, ornate organ. Tharok , never shy of experimentation, sat down to play. His initial haunting notes soon gave way to a cacophony as he pressed multiple keys, unleashing a disgusting blast of \"poo vapors\" that even his sturdy minotaur constitution barely withstood! Undeterred, Tharok's bizarre symphony continued, and from the echoing depths of the sewer, a gigantic, wailing, guttural roar answered his call.</p> <p>The music disturbed more than just the air. In a nearby chamber, the waters began to froth and churn violently. Suddenly, a massive, slimy tentacle erupted, lashing out at the startled Kain ** and ** Rhy-At ! Combat was joined as the dreaded ** Plague Worm** surfaced!</p> <p>The battle was a desperate struggle in the muck and mire. Rhy-At ** unleashed potent Mind Slivers and a scorching, empowered Fireball. ** Kain , a blur of motion, peppered the beast with arrows, his attempt to ensnare it with a net proving futile as the worm's bulk shredded it. The goddess ** Kyra , taking refuge on ** Zephyrion's ** broad back, offered divine encouragement while ** Andrew Lynx pummeled the monstrosity with relentless Eldritch Blasts.</p> <p>The Plague Worm fought back with terrifying ferocity, its Tentacular Tongue grappling heroes and its Putrid Bile spewing forth in a sickening wave. Zephyrion ** , after Nicandros** freed a comrade by blasting a tentacle apart with necrotic energy from his mace, charged into the fray. He landed mighty blows with his Kopis and the chilling Trident of Kenta-Mean, but the worm's retaliatory strike was devastating, and Zephyrion fell unconscious into the filth!</p> <p>Seeing his companion fall, Kain ** channeled the divine power of the Radiance of Mytros sword, its holy light bringing Zephyrion back to his feet, albeit bloodied. The heroes pressed their advantage, weathering the worm's legendary resistances. Finally, grievously wounded, the Plague Worm turned to flee, slithering beneath the murky surface. But ** Kain, enraged, gave chase. Vanishing into the shadows, he unleashed a final, perfectly aimed volley of three arrows, striking true and felling the grotesque beast!</p> <p>Treasures, Tortured Poultry, and Troublesome Thugs:</p> <p>In the aftermath, Kain ** grimly beheaded the bloated corpse. Sifting through its vile innards, ** Rhy-At ** made a startling discovery: the remains of a ** Thieves' Guild ** member and an ornate chest. Within the chest lay ten flawless crystal vials \u2013 five shimmering crimson, five vibrant azure \u2013 alongside a cryptic poem. \"Crimson drinks the mountain's height. Azure sips the fading light... But should you mix the red and blue, a storm of nature comes for you.\" With a successful Arcana check, ** Nikandros deduced the crimson potion enlarged, while the azure shrank.</p> <p>What followed was a truly... unique... scientific endeavor upon your trusty chicken, Henrietta. Administering a thimbleful of both potions simultaneously resulted in a chaotic, grotesque transformation. The poor bird began to wildly expand and contract, different parts growing and shrinking at random, all while squawking in what could only be described as poultry anguish. After much soul-searching and concern over its prolonged, unnatural suffering (and the noise it was making!), and after its headless body continued to pulsate, the decision was made to end its misery, though its remains, still erratically morphing, were bagged for... reasons.</p> <p>After a much-needed short rest, you continued your exploration, soon encountering a heavy, locked iron door. Kain's skilled hands made short work of the lock. However, as he pulled the door open, a beefy goblin appeared, promptly slammed it shut, and relocked it! Not to be deterred, Kain picked the lock again, this time with the party ready for action. As the door swung inward, revealing a room with several thugs and a Yuan-ti, arrows flew!</p> <p>The ensuing fight was swift and decisive. Nikandros ** launched Toll the Dead, ** Andrew expertly counterspelled a Suggestion aimed at Tharok before unleashing a barrage of Eldritch Blasts. Tharok ** , in a barbarian rage, charged past the frontline to engage the Yuan-ti spellcaster. Rhy-At's ** Chromatic Orbs and ** Kain's** deadly arrows quickly dispatched the remaining foes. The hideout was secured, its alarm unrung.</p> <p>Looting the fallen yielded some coin, a tarnished silver serpent ring (another nod to the Thieves' Guild), and an amulet from the goblin boss. Yet another locked door stood before you. Kain , proving himself the master of unlocking, opened it to a startling sight: a rather skanky-looking human woman, Lydia, and another goblin boss, mid-embrace!</p> <p>Interrupted and clearly flustered, the pair prepared for a fight. Rhy-At ** was first to act, slicing the woman's mind with a Mind Sliver. ** Zephyrion , leaping dramatically over his comrades, charged the goblin boss, felling him with two brutal throws of his trident. The terrified Lydia, now alone, was subjected to questioning by a sewer-stench-covered ** Kain . She confirmed that you had indeed stumbled into a hideout of the ** Thieves' Guild (the \"Cult of the Snake\").</p> <p>A Cliffhanger Deception:</p> <p>The session concluded on a razor's edge. Another door remained, behind which more Guild members were undoubtedly alerted. A desperate, convoluted plan was hatched: Lydia, thoroughly intimidated by Tharok ** and the still-twitching bag containing Henrietta's remains, was coerced into approaching the door. ** Rhy-At ** even offered his skills in disguise. Lydia knocked, nervously uttered the password (\"avocado!\"). A slot opened, and a suspicious voice questioned her. Her quavering response immediately raised alarms. Thinking fast, ** Tharok boomed that they were associates of Moxena, the Lady of Coins, and had just saved Lydia from the monstrous Plague Worm, brandishing its severed head as undeniable proof!</p> <p>The Guild members on the other side, though confused by the sight of the gruesome trophy, sternly ordered you to step back from the door\u2026</p> <p>And that's where the darkness, and the session, closed! Will your bold, perhaps reckless, deception succeed? What awaits behind that final door? And what other secrets do the Mytros sewers still hold?</p> <p>We'll find out next time!</p>"},{"location":"wednesday/recaps/recap_session_23.html","title":"Session 23 Recap: Of Thieves, Traps, and Tender Souls","text":""},{"location":"wednesday/recaps/recap_session_23.html#05232025","title":"05/23/2025","text":""},{"location":"wednesday/recaps/recap_session_23.html#heroes-of-the-prophecy-your-last-foray-into-the-stinking-bowels-of-mytros-left-you-at-the-precipice-of-a-tense-standoff-the-severed-head-of-a-plague-worm-your-gruesome-calling-card-to-the-wary-denizens-of-a-thieves-guild-hideout","title":"Heroes of the Prophecy!

After both Zephyrion and Tharok were knocked unconscious, Andrew Lynx dealt the final, decisive blow, destroying Skaethon with a barrage of Eldritch Blasts.</p> <p>Aftermath and Discoveries:</p> <p>With Skaethon vanquished, the remaining specters returned to their duties. In the now-quiet cabin, you found: * Skaethon's Legacy ** : His magical suit of sea-motif armor, Azurescale ** , and his dark sword, Ebony , which is now damaged with a distinct bite mark in the blade. * Treasure ** : A chest containing 300 gp, 50 pp, a black pearl, four bloodstones, an ivory siren statue, a silver dragon comb, and three powerful potions: Felix Felicis (Liquid Luck) ** , a Potion of Etherealness ** , and Sandman's Embrace** .</p> <p>Looking Forward:</p> <p>One thane is down, but two remain. Estor Arkelander sits upon his throne on the upper deck, reading a tome titled \"The Ledger of Wills,\" awaiting the outcome of his challenge. You now have confirmation that his offer is a trap for possession. Meanwhile, Rhy-At holds a water-logged journal from a fallen adventurer, its secrets yet unread, and Zephyrion has befriended a mysterious, ghostly gray owl that watches from the rigging. You must now decide how to proceed with Estor's deadly game to claim the Ultros.</p>"},{"location":"wednesday/recaps/recap_session_30.html","title":"Session 30 Recap: Thrice Defeated","text":"<p>07/16/2025</p> <p>Heroes of the Prophecy! Your battle for the soul of the Ultros had just begun. In the quiet aftermath of your clash with the first mate Skaethon, you took stock of your spoils\u2014the magical armor Azurescale, the bite-marked sword Ebony, and a collection of strange, powerful potions. With the captain\u2019s challenge still ringing in your ears, you chose not to be his pawns. Instead, you forged your own path.</p> <p>You sought out the remaining \"traitorous\" thanes, not as assassins, but as allies. First, you found Metron, the Navigator, who agreed to help you overthrow the tyrannical Captain Estor. His price: a promise to free the spectral crew from their 500-year servitude and to safeguard an ornate, magically sealed box that pulsed with contained spirits. Next, you confronted Davos, the Quartermaster, on the top deck. He too pledged his support, promising to keep the spectral rowers from joining the fray, so long as you secured the aid of his fellow thanes. Between these tense negotiations, Kain communed with Delphia, the dryad spirit of the ship, who whispered a cryptic warning: \"He must be defeated thrice.\"</p> <p>With new alliances forged, you prepared for the final confrontation. Zephyrion and Tharok, chugging powerful potions, swelled to immense, ship-rocking proportions, while Andrew Lynx shrank to a fraction of his size. As you approached Estor Arkelander on his throne, he hurled a vicious taunt at Kyra, igniting her fury and the battle. Estor\u2019s initial spells were snuffed out by a rapid series of counterspells from Rhy-At and Andrew, leaving him open. Empowered by Haste, the giant forms of Zephyrion and Tharok unleashed a devastating onslaught, grievously wounding the ghost captain. In a desperate act of retaliation, Estor cast a wave of terror, causing Tharok to drop his axe and flee. But it was not enough. A final, searing Eldritch Blast from Andrew Lynx struck true, and Estor\u2019s form dissolved into ash.</p> <p>But as Delphia had warned, the fight was not over. A purple meteor streaked from the heavens, slamming into the deck and erupting in a blast of psychic fire. From the crater rose a Giant Skeleton wreathed in psychic energy\u2014Estor\u2019s second form. The battle raged anew. Kyra, incandescent with rage, unleashed a powerful lightning bolt from her wand, but in a flash, it was absorbed by Tharok\u2019s axe, supercharging the weapon with crackling energy. Now recovered from his fear, Tharok landed a thunderous blow, discharging the stored lightning and dealing immense damage. Zephyrion followed with a flurry of his own, and the skeletal form was shattered.</p> <p>As the bones crumbled, the air grew deathly cold. Frost crept across the decks as a blood-red moon rose with unnatural speed. A crimson beam shone down, and from it, Estor\u2019s final, Ghostly Apparition emerged. This was his most dangerous form. After weathering another onslaught, the ghost vanished and reappeared inside Tharok, possessing him. Kyra screamed a warning, and you were faced with a terrible choice. Focusing your attacks on your enthralled friend, you managed to knock him unconscious, forcing Estor\u2019s spirit out. Exposed once more, the ghost captain was quickly overwhelmed. Wielding a flaming kopis, Zephyrion stabbed the apparition again and again, finally destroying the tyrant of the Ultros for good.</p> <p>With Estor truly defeated, the spirit of Delphia was freed. She floated from the mast and, with a gentle kiss, breathed life back into the fallen Tharok. You now have control of the legendary ghost ship. A new captain must be chosen, and a decision made about the spectral crew. </p>"},{"location":"wednesday/recaps/recap_session_31.html","title":"Session 31 Recap: The Anointing of the Heroes","text":"<p>07/23/2025</p> <p>Heroes of the Prophecy! Your victory aboard the Ultros was absolute. With its tyrannical captain vanquished, the soul of the ship, Delphia, called for a new master. Kain, you stepped forward, swearing an oath upon the ancient mast, and the legendary vessel accepted you. With a will bound to your own, the Ultros became your instrument.</p> <p>Your return to Mytros was a spectacle of impossible magic. At your command, the ghost ship dove beneath the waves, gliding through the silent depths in a shimmering bubble of air, emerging into the Cerulean Gulf in a fraction of the time a mortal ship would take. But your arrival did not go unnoticed. You were immediately summoned to the palace, where you navigated the viper's nest of the royal court with cunning. While Rhy-At slipped away to deliver the true story to a grateful Queen Vallus, the rest of you faced her husband. Before a seething King Acastus, you masterfully evaded his demands, leaving the covetous monarch empty-handed and furious.</p> <p>Your loyalty was richly rewarded. Queen Vallus entrusted you with a sacred mission: to sail the seas and stop the titans Sydon and Lutheria before their Oath of Peace expires. To aid you, she bestowed upon you the Antikythera, a divine compass to navigate the treacherous waters. But your quest was clear: the device was missing a crucial gear, stolen and hidden on the Isle of Yonder.</p> <p>With your grand purpose set, you prepared for the voyage. You sought the favor of the gods, bathing in the five sacred pools of their temple and emerging with powerful, permanent boons. After stocking up on vital potions and scrolls for the dangers to come, you made your move. You orchestrated a grand ceremony at the docks to legitimize your claim to the ghost ship. Pythor, the God of Battle himself, arrived to join your quest, and before the assembled thousands, he anointed you the true Heroes of the Prophecy.</p> <p>Then, at the height of the ritual, as all of Mytros watched, you unleashed your masterstroke. Kain, you called, and the sea itself answered. With a sound like distant thunder, the legendary Ultros rose spectacularly from the harbor's depths, its black sails unfurling to greet its new masters. The crowd erupted. In that moment, your legend was forged. Gifts were showered upon you, and a hundred brave souls, inspired by your divine mandate, volunteered to join your crew.</p> <p>Now, you stand upon the deck of your ghost ship, new allies at your side, the hopes of a kingdom at your back, and a loyal crew awaiting your command. The Antikythera points the way to isles of fire and scorpion, but the ultimate prize lies on the Isle of Yonder. The sea calls.

As you prepared to leave Mytros, King Acastus landed his dragon upon the </p> <p>Ultros, rocking the ghost ship as he delivered a thinly veiled threat, reminding you that he would do whatever is necessary to protect his city from any troubles you might invite. But loyalty has its own rewards. Queen Vallus entrusted Rhy-At with a Mithral token holding a vision from Volkan himself. In that flash of scrying, you saw a great library carved into a cliffside, where a blue-skinned tiefling named Chondrus clutched a familiar, pulsing diamond\u2014a fragment of Rhy-At's own mind. A single name echoed in the void, binding your quests together: </p> <p>Yonder.</p> <p>With your course set, the sea itself offered an unexpected detour. An uncharted paradise appeared on the horizon\u2014an island not on any map, for it was alive, a colossal turtle swimming through the Cerulean Gulf. This sanctuary, Jazirat Zulhaf, was a hub of strange travelers, from the disciplined warrior monks of Aresia to a blind Triton, Maelon, who guarded a mysterious, glowing shrine. A booming voice led you to the island's master of trade: Shazam, a Marid of the ocean depths. He offered a quest\u2014bring him the eggs of fire snakes from a place of great heat, and he would reward you handsomely. A hard bargain was struck; for four pristine eggs, he would trade a </p> <p>Driftwood Wand and the legendary Disintegrating Nightwalkers.</p> <p>Your journey continued, but you were not alone. Aboard the Ultros, a new life stirred. Amidst flashes of golden light, the Wyvern egg cracked open. The newborn creature, no larger than a housecat, looked past the ship's spirit and fixed its gaze upon the slender captain hiding behind the mast. In that moment, Kain, you became a father. You named him </p> <p>Bubbles.</p> <p>Finally, you reached your destination: Fire Island, a land of dense jungle with a black mountain rising at its center, the smell of brimstone hanging heavy in the air. You were met by the Bloodscale tribe of Lizardfolk, whose shaman revealed their queen was expecting your arrival. But as they led you inland, your guides froze. Ahead, a rival tribe, the Firewalkers, held a Bloodscale historian captive, demanding the location of a dragon egg while two serpentine creatures wreathed in flame slithered menacingly toward her.</p> <p>You did not hesitate. From the shadows, Kain, your arrows flew, turning both fire snakes to smoldering ash. Tharok, you exploded from the foliage like a bull in a china shop, your newly-repaired axe cutting down a warrior with the ease of a knife through butter. As their leader fled, Zephyrion, you teleported into his path and ended his escape with a fatal thrust of your trident.</p> <p>The historian is saved, and the enemy is scattered.

You arrived at the Bloodscale village, a collection of reed-thatched huts clinging to the edge of a slow-moving river, where life and ritual moved in equal measure. Your attention was quickly drawn to two things: a crude bamboo cage holding sullen Firewalker prisoners, and a strange, sacred cauldron bubbling with iridescent, hallucinogenic vapor.</p> <p>While some of you interrogated the captive leader, Kretz\u2014who spun a web of obvious lies about the weakness of his fortress and king\u2014Tharok was drawn to the cauldron. Inhaling deeply, his mind was thrown into a powerful vision. He saw a colossal black serpent coiled around the volcano and was met by a beautiful woman of pure flame, the goddess Chalcia, who bestowed a cryptic kiss upon his cheek.</p> <p>You were brought before the tribe\u2019s leader, the commanding Queen Vytha. To seal your new alliance, she announced a great honor: a sacred feast. You were to be the honored guests, and the centerpiece of the meal was to be her own son, Prince Skrill, who stepped forward willingly to be sacrificed for your strength.</p> <p>Faced with this grisly honor, you hesitated. In a moment of quick thinking, Andrew Lynx created a diversion, firing a blast of arcane energy into the jungle to fake an attack. The ruse worked perfectly. The feast was postponed, and you feigned a pursuit of the non-existent enemies into the wilderness.</p> <p>Once alone, you debated the shocking tradition. It was Rhy-At, looking to the stars and the alignment of the heavens with his strange instruments, who uncovered the truth. This was no mere cannibalism; it was a powerful ritual. To consume the prince's flesh was to harmonize your very being with the fundamental forces of creation. With this knowledge, you returned to the village, ready to accept the queen\u2019s offer.</p> <p>The ceremony resumed under the moonlight. As the drums beat, Prince Skrill was led atop the stone ziggurat. In a moment of divine subversion, Rhy-At secretly consecrated the tribe\u2019s ceremonial dagger to the Five Gods before handing it to the shaman, who then plunged the blade into the prince\u2019s heart.</p> <p>At the solemn feast that followed, you each made your choice. * Kain, Tharok, and Rhy-At partook of the sacred meal. * Andrew Lynx and Nikandros, citing otherworldly and moral reasons, refused the offering. * Both Bubbles and Bjorn were fed portions, and you watched as they grew subtly larger and more powerful before your eyes.</p> <p>For those of you who accepted the sacrifice, a new, unshakable power now hums beneath your skin. You feel stronger than you have ever been, your movements quicker and more certain, your thoughts clearer. Tharok feels as though the prince\u2019s courage and spirit have truly become a part of him. Rhy-At feels a deeply calming, profound connection to the rhythmic pulse of the nearby sea. It is a fundamental change, a feeling of being more than you were before.</p> <p>Now, rested and fortified with both a feast and an unnatural power, you prepare to make your move. The queen\u2019s spy awaits to guide you to a secret path, a hidden entrance that leads directly into the fiery heart of your enemy\u2019s domain\u2014the volcano fortress of the Firewalkers.</p>"},{"location":"wednesday/recaps/recap_session_34.html","title":"Session 34 Recap: The Serpent's Counsel","text":"<p>The night of the sacred feast settled over the Bloodscale village, heavy with the weight of ritual and the promise of violence to come. Before retiring, the party conceived a daring plan: to free the captive Firewalker prisoners and use them as a trojan horse to gain an audience with King Jankor. They brought this idea of a double-agent gambit before Queen Vytha, expecting to impress her with their cunning.</p> <p>However, the lizardfolk queen proved to be a far more shrewd strategist. She listened intently before systematically dismantling their plan, pointing out Jankor's paranoia and the near-certainty of betrayal. Instead of adopting their plan, she swayed them, convincing the party that a direct, secret assault was the only path that guaranteed the Firewalkers' destruction. The party, respecting her cold logic, agreed to follow her original strategy.</p> <p>During these evening discussions, Rhy-At sought out the head shaman, Sessith. The shaman shared his tribe's ancient oral traditions regarding the stars, providing Rhy-At with crucial clues to help decipher the Antikythera device. He explained how constellations like \"The Prisoner\" corresponded to their own Fire Island and how \"The Twins\" was the star-path followed by the raiders from Themis.</p> <p>With their plans finalized, the party was led to a guest hut to rest. That night, their sleep was filled with potent visions. * Kain, Tharok, and Rhy-At, who had partaken in the feast, shared a powerful dream. They stood in the heart of the volcano where the spirit of Prince Skrill rose from the magma, not as a victim, but as a being of immense power. He affirmed their bond, granting them a vision of King Jankor's weakness and imbuing them with the island's primal strength, urging them to \"break the hollow king\". * Andrew Lynx and Nikandros experienced a more distant, solemn dream. They witnessed Skrill's spirit give them a respectful nod from afar before dissolving into smoke and merging with the volcano, a clear sign that while they were allies, they remained outsiders to the tribe's deepest magic.</p> <p>The next morning began with the Volcanic Protection Ritual. Sessith the shaman prepared a foul-smelling paste of mud, oils, and rendered fat, anointing the party with the Thek'mor Vulash to shield them from the volcano's intense heat and poisonous fumes. As they readied to depart, Kain engaged their guide, Xatli, in a test of ranger skills. Her brilliant response established a deep professional respect between the two scouts.</p> <p>Building on this newfound respect, the party made a crucial appeal. They persuaded Xatli that her duty was not just to guide them to the fortress, but through it. Arguing that her skills were essential to the mission's success\u2014and therefore to her people's survival and her own vengeance\u2014they convinced her to join their infiltration. Torn between her queen's direct order and her duty to ensure the mission's success, Xatli agreed to defy her instructions and accompany them all the way.</p> <p>Led now by their new accomplice, the party began their infiltration. They entered the fortress through the Secret Entrance (V4), a narrow and treacherous but untrapped path carved down the caldera wall. This route allowed them to bypass the main defenses, leading them directly into the Firewalker barracks: the Sleeping Chambers (V6). There, under the cover of darkness, the party executed a brutal and effective strike, slaying the sleeping Firewalker guards in their hammocks before they could raise an alarm. A search of the chambers revealed items that told a story: a desecrated Bloodscale banner, and the diary of a young, disillusioned warrior questioning Jankor's rule.</p> <p>The session ended with the party having successfully established a secure, if bloody, foothold deep within the volcano, their primary objective\u2014the egg chambers\u2014still lying deeper within.</p>"}]}
