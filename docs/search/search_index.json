The Summons at The Sour Vintage Inn  </li> <li>Keerah's Summons: We were summoned to The Sour Vintage Inn, located twenty miles east of Estoria. Keerah, a renowned poet, revealed herself to be an agent of the Oracle. She informed us of our great destiny and tasked us with hunting a corrupted giant boar, unleashed by the Titans, Sydon and Lutheria, to terrorize the Heartlands.  </li> <li>The Task: Keerah explained that the boar was a symbol of the weakening Oath of Peace, which once protected the mortals of Thylea from the wrath of the Titans. This boar had already slain many, and Keerah urged us to prove ourselves as the heroes of prophecy by slaying the beast.  </li> <li>2. The Hunt for the Corrupted Boar  </li> <li>Journey into the Heartlands: We set off at dawn, guided by two scouts, Taneias and Javon. The morning was cold and foggy as we ventured northward, passing ravaged farms and gouged trees\u2014grim signs of the boar's rampage.  </li> <li>The Battle: We tracked the boar to its lair, a cave strewn with the remains of its victims. The beast ambushed us, and in the ensuing battle, one of our scouts, Taneias, was tragically slain.   </li> <li>Aella launched her mighty chakram at the beast, slitting its throat and laying it low. We emerged victorious, slaying the corrupted boar.  </li> <li>The Boar's Prophecy: Before it died, the boar spoke to us in our minds, warning of an ancient power that sleeps in Thylea and prophesying doom and darkness for all mortal things. It claimed that no prophecy would save us from this fate.  </li> <li>3. The Sacrifice and Return to The Sour Vintage  </li> <li>Honoring Pythor: Following Aella's advice, we burned the remains of the boar as a sacrificial offering to Pythor, the god of battle. In doing so, we hoped to honor him and gain his favor in the battles to come.   </li> <li>Aella intuits the favor of Pythor, god of Battle.  </li> <li>We recover some treasure and a magical silver spear, which is held by Rheana.  </li> <li>Return to The Sour Vintage: We returned to The Sour Vintage Inn as heroes. The townsfolk greeted us with cheers and gratitude for freeing them from the terror of the boar. We spent the evening resting and reflecting on the day's events.  </li> <li>Astreaus played an amazing performance regaling the audience with tales and song of our mighty deeds. He made a lot of gold in the process.  </li> <li>Level up to 2  </li> <li>4. The Oracle's Prophecy  </li> <li>The Next Step: The following day, Kyrah reminded us of the importance of visiting the Oracle at her temple to the east. She believes that the Oracle, Versi, will reveal the next steps in our journey and provide us with guidance on how to avert the coming catastrophe.  </li> <li>Journey to the Temple: We set off through the wilderness, leaving behind the comfort of The Sour Vintage and traveling through the Heartlands toward the temple. The journey took us nearly a day, and we arrived at the temple, ready to learn what the Oracle has foreseen.  </li> <li>5.

flames erupted but were dampened by your quick thinking, allowing you to reach the lower levels singed but alive.  </li> <li>The Silent Armory </li> <li>Stepping into a vast armory once brimming with legendary weapons, you found only echoes of the past.  </li> <li>Empty racks and shattered armaments told stories of looting and time's relentless decay.  </li> <li>Despite thorough searching, valuable relics eluded you, perhaps hidden or long removed.  </li> <li>Encounter with the Forgekeeper </li> <li>Moving south, you discovered a grand chamber dominated by a bubbling pool of lava\u2014a creature swam beneath its molten surface.  </li> <li>Two death dogs guarded an enigmatic bronze sphere with a protruding spout.  </li> <li>Without hesitation, Aella led the charge against the guardians.  </li> <li>Rheana invoked the Fear of the Dragonlords , her presence unsettling the death dogs and giving you the upper hand.  </li> <li>Upon their defeat, a serpentine figure emerged from the lava\u2014the salamander known as Pyra, the Forgekeeper.  </li> <li>She warned of the enchanted sphere, a deadly trap designed by the dwarves to keep her bound.  </li> <li>Disarming the Frozen Trap </li> <li>Investigating the sphere, you attempted to disable it but only delayed its activation.  </li> <li>As ominous clicks sounded, Pyra urged you to flee before a blast of freezing magic engulfed the room.  </li> <li>Refusing to be thwarted, you heaved the sphere onto Rheana's sturdy back.  </li> <li>With a combined effort, you hurled it over the edge, watching as it plummeted into the waterfall below\u2014its icy explosion freezing the cascading waters momentarily.  </li> <li>Alliance with Pyra </li> <li>Grateful for your intervention, Pyra introduced herself and revealed her plight.  </li> <li>Tricked by the dwarves, she had been bound to power the forge for centuries.  </li> <li>She offered to reignite the legendary Mithral Forge if you agreed to destroy the rune tablet anchoring her to this place.  </li> <li>Pyra cautioned you about the young cerberus ahead, a fearsome guardian sent by Lutheria herself.  </li> <li>She suggested diplomacy but remained ready to assist in battle if needed.  </li> <li>The Fierce Battle with the Cerberus </li> <li>Undeterred, Delphi approached the cerberus, attempting to negotiate.  </li> <li>The beast snarled, its three heads echoing with malice, and vowed to devour you all.  </li> <li>The fight was brutal\u2014the cerberus's powerful jaws and venomous bites pushed you to your limits.  </li> <li>Pyra joined the fray, ensnaring the creature with her fiery tail and encasing one of its heads in hardened magma.  </li> <li>Amidst the chaos, several of you suffered grievous wounds and the sting of poison.  </li> <li>In a final, decisive move, Delphi unleashed a scorching firebolt, striking down the monstrous hound.  </li> <li>Liberation and Rekindling the Forge </li> <li>Among the cerberus's hoard, you found treasures and the rune tablet binding Pyra.  </li> <li>Honoring your promise, Delphi shattered the tablet;

King Driptongue and his ruthless minions began descending the dwarven elevator, determined to seize control of the forge. Defensive Preparations: </li> <li>Pyra, the fiery Forgekeeper, teamed up with the party to set up intricate traps throughout the forge, preparing for the inevitable assault by the troglodyte horde. Hordes Descend: </li> <li>A relentless wave of troglodytes launched their attack on the forge's defenses, overwhelming the party with sheer numbers and vicious ferocity. Clash with the Troglodytes: </li> <li>In a fierce and harrowing battle, the heroes fought valiantly alongside Pyra. Amidst the chaos, Pyra ensnared King Driptongue with her mighty tail, forcing him to surrender. Aella's Ruthless Justice: </li> <li>Despite King Driptongue's pleas for mercy, the unyielding Amazon Warrior, Aella, delivered a brutal end to the tyrant, ensuring he would never threaten Estoria again.  </li> <li>Pyra cautioned Aella about the repercussions of such brutality, warning that the party's reputation could suffer, but Aella remained steadfast in her actions. Pyra's Offer: </li> <li>With King Driptongue defeated, Pyra revealed her ability to craft powerful items for the heroes, offering them legendary gear in exchange for their continued assistance. Night of Terror: </li> <li>Exhausted after the day's battles, the party spent the night within the Mithral Forge. They were plagued by a terrifying dream vision from the Titan Lutheria, waking up in cold sweats and experiencing short-term madness. Centaur Gratitude: </li> <li>Following the harrowing night, the heroes returned to the banks of the Arkelon River to receive their reward from the centaurs: three potions of heroism, tokens of gratitude for rescuing their missing kin. Meeting with Volkan: </li> <li>Back in Estoria, the party consulted with Volkan, the grumpy dwarven blacksmith and true God of the Forge. He explained that he needed King Pythor's hammer to repair the party's broken weapons and armor.  </li> <li>The heroes hired Volkan to craft a special suit of plate armor for Rhaena, costing 1500 gp and taking four days to complete.  Hunting the Basilisks: </li> <li>Determined to eliminate the threat to Princess Anora, the party ventured to the Rock of Estor in search of the petrifying basilisks.  </li> <li>Delphi, utilizing his mystic abilities, summoned an octopus familiar to scout the river upstream. The octopus successfully located the basilisks' lair within a hidden cave.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"friday/logs/log_session_12.html","title":"Session 12","text":"<p>Agenda</p> <ul> <li>The Great Labors  </li> <li>~~Claim the Weapons of the Dragonlords~~  </li> <li>~~Relight the fires of the Mithral Forge~~  </li> <li>~~Drink from the Horn of Balmytria~~   </li> <li>Aella: Gather allies and return to the Isle of Themis and overthrow the usurpers who murdered your mother and stole her throne  </li> <li>Astreus: Seek out the Wisdom of Queen Vallus in Mytros to further your quest for knowledge  </li> <li>Delphi: Xander gave you your crown and his mystic armaments.

These monstrous creatures, harbingers of petrification, had claimed the lives and freedom of many\u2014including a group of ill-fated bandits now frozen in stone.  </li> <li>The Battle: You fought valiantly against these creatures, narrowly avoiding their petrifying gazes. Each strike of your weapons reverberated through the cavern, and though the battle was fierce, your resolve never wavered.  </li> <li>The Spoils of War: You harvested precious basilisk ichor, a key alchemical component. Some will be used to craft a salve to cure petrification\u2014others, perhaps, for darker purposes. From the corpse of a basilisk, you claimed its fearsome head, destined to enhance a magical shield under the skilled hands of Volkan, the God of the Forge.  </li> <li>A Choice Left Behind: Despite recovering the salve, you chose not to release the petrified bandits\u2014a somber reminder of the cost of greed and violence in the wilds of Thylea.  </li> <li>The Hidden Treasure: In the shadowy depths of the cavern, you uncovered a trapped chest filled with modest loot, adding a small glimmer of triumph to the grim surroundings. The Centaur Encampment </li> <li>On your journey back to Estoria, the sound of drums and hooves led you to the centaur encampment, where the air crackled with tension and ancient grievances.  </li> <li>Baenor's Words: Meeting with Baenor, the chieftain of the centaurs, you explained your plan to take Princess Anora's place as a sacrifice to Sydon. Baenor's sarcasm was biting as he wished you \"good luck,\" urging you to deal with Gaius and pray to your gods and ancestors\u2014for your souls were already in peril. Negotiating with Gaius </li> <li>Back in King Pythor's palace, you stood before the heavily-armored Gaius, commander of the Order of Sydon. With determination and Astreus's silver tongue, you convinced him to accept your self-sacrifice in place of Anora.  </li> <li>The Bargain Struck: Gaius reveled in the deal, mocking your bravery as four heroes offered themselves in exchange for what he considered a \"useless princess.\" However, you cunningly persuaded him to move the sacrifice to the following night, saving precious time for your preparations. A Royal Thanks </li> <li>King Pythor, overcome with gratitude, summoned Princess Anora. She tearfully thanked you for your noble choice, gifting you a magical pendant to bring you luck as you face the horrors of the Rock of Estor.  </li> <li>The King's Hammer: Pythor promised his magical hammer as your reward if you survive. This weapon, forged by Volkan and steeped in divine power, is a treasure of legend and a beacon of hope for Estoria.  </li> <li>Anora's Warning: She urged you to leave your equipment with her to avoid it being pilfered by Sydon's acolytes during the ritual. Demetria's Prison </li> <li>In the depths of Pythor's dungeon, you confronted Demetria, the vengeful dryad who once twisted innocent souls into monstrous maenads in her service to Lutheria.  </li> <li>The Heirloom's Secret: Rheana demanded the return of her family ring, a precious artifact connected to her forgotten lineage and prophecy. Demetria, bitter and defiant, refused at first but relented after being put to sleep and swearing an oath to the party.  </li> <li>The Oath Fulfilled: Bound by her words, Demetria produced the ring like a magician, conjuring it from thin air. She revealed that the Ritual Tome\u2014her dark grimoire of transformation\u2014had been a gift from her mistress, Lutheria.  </li> <li>Freedom Granted: Though wary, you honored her oath, releasing her from captivity. With haughty arrogance, Demetria departed the palace, her connection to Lutheria an ominous thread still tied to your fates. A Declaration to Estoria </li> <li>Delphi, ever the voice of the people, announced your intention to stand in Anora's stead to the bustling agora. A crowd gathered, whispering of your courage and folly in equal measure. Delphi assured them that the gods themselves would protect you, turning the sacrifice into a spectacle for all to witness. Evening Preparations </li> <li>As night fell, you each took to your tasks:  </li> <li>Astreus's Performance: At the Dragon's Tooth Inn, Astreus captivated the crowd with music, his lute case overflowing with coins by the end of the night.  </li> <li>Aella's Watchful Eye: Aella's mechanical bird soared back to the basilisk cave, ensuring no further dangers stirred within its depths.  </li> <li>Delphi's Vigil: Delphi shadowed Gaius through the darkened streets of Estoria, uncovering the location of an unassuming house frequented by acolytes of Sydon.</li> </ul> <p>Lutheria's Wrath</p> <ul> <li>In the dead of night, the shadow of Lutheria descended upon your dreams. Each of you was plagued by visions of terror and madness:  </li> <li>Rheana's Torment: Hallucinations of Lutheria's scorn haunted Rheana, her reflection twisted in the mirror and the night sky. Drawing upon her paladin's grace, she calmed her mind and banished the horrors.  </li> <li>Aella's Silence: Stricken by an unnatural dumbness, Aella's voice was stolen, leaving her unable to speak. Despite your efforts, the curse lingers, a cruel reminder of Lutheria's power.  </li> <li>A Frightened Resolve: As dawn approaches, you wake shaken but determined. The stakes have never been higher, and Lutheria has made her disdain for you clear.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"friday/logs/log_session_13.html","title":"Session 13","text":"<p>Agenda</p> <ul> <li>Aella: Gather allies and return to the Isle of Themis and overthrow the usurpers who murdered your mother and stole her throne  </li> <li>Astreus: Seek out the Wisdom of Queen Vallus in Mytros to further your quest for knowledge  </li> <li>Delphi: Xander gave you your crown and his mystic armaments.

Though framed as an act of reverence, it is a horrifying and despised option, tantamount to sacrificing the innocent.  </li> <li>Bella the Concubine: Suggests performing a traditional hecatomb\u2014sacrificing 100 oxen to placate Sydon. This option would require significant resources, depleting the livestock of Mytros and straining its economy.  </li> <li>Queen Vallus:Advocates for a miraculous act by the gods.

The harp is in the possession of Boreas, a satyr and former ally of Kyrah, who resides at a vineyard near the city. The heroes must negotiate, trick, or take the harp by force.

She identified the Cult of Lutheria as a particular threat, operating under the guise of generosity while spreading corruption and Titan influence.  </li> <li>She requested the party investigate the Temple of Lutheria in Stygian Row to uncover evidence of their malevolence, advising caution to avoid provoking chaos.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Personal Threads (Optional): <ul> <li>Vallus addressed specific party members' epic paths if applicable, offering tailored advice or quests. For instance, she mentioned the plight of the Amazons to an exile or directed a seeker of knowledge toward the Lotus Witch.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Final Warning: <ul> <li>Vallus reiterated that Acastus must not learn of the party's success with the Ultros, warning them of the dangers his control over the legendary ship could bring.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Before leaving the Queen's chambers, Aella met the Queen's Amazon   </li> <li>Makhaira's Revelation: Aella's family was betrayed, her mother slain, and Aella framed as a coward by usurpers.  </li> <li>Makhaira and her warriors were exiled for questioning the false rulers, later finding sanctuary with Queen Vallus.  </li> <li>State of Themis: Shrines to the Great Mothers destroyed, replaced by Lutheria's statues.  </li> <li>Usurpers rule through fear, with maenads and goatlings spreading chaos.  </li> <li>Loyalists to the old ways hide in secret camps.  </li> <li>Makhaira's Promise: Makhaira pledged to honor Aella's claim and support her when the time comes.  </li> <li>She encouraged Aella to prove her worth by embodying strength and wisdom to unite the Amazons.  </li> <li>Advice for Aella:  </li> <li>Seek loyalists among the hidden camps on Themis.  </li> <li>Prepare to lead with courage and inspire the sisterhood to rise against the usurpers.  </li> <li>We talk to the dragon Icarus and Delphi notices that he acts younger than a dragon of his size and age should.

We slew them after a tough battle  </li> <li>Continuing on, we reach the edge of Boreas's Vineyard.  </li> <li>We notice that the violent hurricane is not really affecting the vineyard. We can see its effects battering the countryside outside of its bounds  </li> <li>Kyrah revealed some of her past with Boreas. They had a falling out several years ago.  </li> <li>Kyrah's Past with Boreas: Kyrah, once known as Notos, was part of the Four Winds, a group of musicians who inspired others through their music. Boreas, the Winter Wind, was a former companion who became envious of the Boreal Harp's power.  </li> <li>Betrayal and Conflict: Boreas, influenced by Lutheria, stole the Boreal Harp after feeling betrayed when Kyrah shifted her focus to helping others, like the party. He now resides in the vineyard and will not part with the harp willingly.  </li> <li>Kyrah's Regret and Warning: Kyrah expresses regret for not revealing this sooner, acknowledges her past failures, and warns the party to be cautious with Boreas, who thrives on chaos. She places her trust in them to succeed where she could not.  </li> <li>We enter the vineyard and wonder at the bounty of delectable grapes  </li> <li>We discover the Sylvan compass and Astreus reads the script around it in Sylvan, although we don't figure out what its purpose is  </li> <li>We knock on the front door of the Villa and are met by the Evelina. She is taking care of the two Satyr children.   </li> <li>She asks us if we are here to buy wine and we tell her we are looking for Boreus. She says he is not at home and offers us two varieties of delicious wine, one of which casts \"calm emotions\" on us.  </li> <li>We convince her to let us stay the night and she agrees for a price of 10 silver each.  </li> <li>She says we can walk up the river and go look for Boreus who is probably playing his harp and entertaining the river nymphs. She says for us to come back in an hour or two and she will feed us dinner. We will stay in the guest room and she will make us a hot bath.  </li> <li>We follow the river north and discover Boreas playing his harp for a bunch of river spirits. When we approach they all leap into the river and disappear from sight.  </li> <li>He addresses us with disdain and sarcasm, implying that Kyrah is using us.   </li> <li>Delphi starts talking to him to try and get him to act more agreeable to us. Delphi rolls very poorly on his persuasion check and the party's bard Astreus swoops in, using his powers of persuasion and rescues the situation. Astresus rolls very well on his persuasion and gets Boreas to warm to the party. He agrees to come back to the Villa and eat dinner and play music with the party and Kyrah.  </li> <li>We return to the Villa and have a nice dinner and magical wine. and play music and recount old times together</li> </ul>"},{"location":"friday/logs/log_session_15.html","title":"Session 15","text":"<p>Agenda</p> <ul> <li>Aella: Gather allies and return to the Isle of Themis and overthrow the usurpers who murdered your mother and stole her throne  </li> <li>Astreus: Queen Vallus has guided you to seek out the Lotus Witch, who may possess the fabled grimoire you need for your chronicles.

Yet the truth proved more complex - it was Moxena who had discovered young Aella that bloody night, and rather than following orders to kill the child, had secretly arranged her escape.  </li> <li>Having failed in her own later attempt to overthrow her sisters, Moxena now offers an alliance from her bronze sanctuary: aid in Aella's quest to reclaim her rightful throne, but first demands proof of loyalty - Lord Neurdagon's head. Three petrified victims stand as silent witnesses to your oath, sworn not to reveal her hidden stronghold within the ancient Colossus.  </li> <li>The pieces of prophecy begin to align - the Oracle's words about finding an ally \"in the head of god\" now ring with new meaning, though whether Moxena's offer represents salvation or a deeper betrayal remains to be seen.

The final prize, the second Brass Dragon Egg, lay hidden within the sweltering cave of the salamanders, Ignis and Cindra. Testing the cracked, glowing floor proved perilous, as Astraeus discovered when his foot ignited upon contact! Prudence demanded another approach.  </p> <p>Harnessing potent magic, Delphi and Aella prepared potions of Spider Climb, while Astraeus invoked his enchanted lute to take flight. With Delphi scaling the walls like an arachnid, Astraeus floated into the cavern, confronting the protective salamanders. Wielding Jankor's captured Staff of Thunder and Lightning, Astraeus channeled newfound authority, mixing diplomacy with intimidation. Though wary, the salamanders yielded before the symbol of their fallen master and the party's demonstrated power, allowing you to claim the ancient Brass Dragon Egg \u2013 a key step in Delphi's path as the Vanished One. While there, Delphi also skillfully extracted several of the strange, humming red crystals embedded in the cave walls.  </p> <p>Rallying your allies \u2013 the rescued Bloodscale warriors, the young dragonling Pyraxis (now fixated on the second egg and questioning Jankor's lies), and the eager Jancan smith Steros \u2013 you prepared to leave the smoldering fortress. A brief, unsettling encounter with the ancient, blind cyclops Polyphorus in his opulent chambers ended with you wisely declining his ominous arm-wrestling challenge after a quick consult with Steros.  </p> <p>With the fortress explored and its treasures secured (including Jankor's secret lockbox ), you emerged into the jungle, guided back to the Bloodscale village. Queen Vytha hailed your victory, declaring the spoils of the fortress yours by right. But more than treasure, she offered an ancient blessing. As dawn broke, amidst drumming and Sessith's Draconic chants, Queen Vytha performed the Ritual of the Volcano's Heart. Anointing each of you with a paste of ash, scales, and moss, she drew symbols that surged with intense heat before settling into your skin, granting you the permanent Blessing of the Volcano's Heart \u2013 newfound resilience against fire.  </p> <p>Returning to the Ultros, celebration mingled with new beginnings. Rhaena greeted Nissy, who returned bearing a gleaming Silver Dragon Egg! Delphi's expertise revealed both his Brass Egg and Rhaena's Silver Egg would hatch in a mere fifteen days. Steros set about finding space for his forge and tools, agreeing to help construct an incubator. Meanwhile, the contents of Jankor's hidden lockbox were examined: a journal written in Draconic, a Potion of Fire Breath, a potent Scroll of Lightning Bolt, valuable gems, a sinister Obsidian Sacrificial Dagger, a suspicious Potion of Storm Giant Strength seemingly tainted by Sydon, and a heavy, pulsating obsidian geode trapping a fiendish entity.  </p> <p>As you set sail, a Siren messenger delivered a crucial letter from Aesop, Keeper of the Dragon Shrine, revealing his suspicion that other ancient dragons might still live, captured by the Titans. Your journey then took you back to the wandering Jazirat Zul'Haf, the Turtle Island. There, you delivered the promised fire snake eggs to the delighted marid, Shazum. As reward, you chose the mysterious Orb of Star Metal. Shazum, ever the trader, tasked you with acquiring a Perfect Basilisk Eye from your next destination \u2013 Themis \u2013 offering a choice of magical items or gold in return. You bartered with him, selling the risky Sydon-touched potion and purchasing scrolls and the Crusher's Ring for Aella, while Delphi acquired an Elemental Mote. A brief stop at the Floating Lantern tavern introduced you to the shaken Captain Arion, who recounted a harrowing tale of giant birds and shipwreck near the Aerie of the Roc, providing valuable, if terrifying, intelligence about the Forgotten Sea.  </p> <p>With the Antikythera set for the Constellation of the Twins, you finally arrived at Themis, the legendary island of the Amazons. Guided by the knowledgeable warrior Makhaira, Aella stepped onto her homeland after thirteen long years of exile. The vast grasslands stretched before you, beautiful yet tense. Initial aerial scouting by Aella's Stimfay revealed herds of strange creatures, rhino riders, basilisk hounds, scattered war camps, and, ominously, a small island in the eastern bay covered in statue-like figures \u2013 the likely heart of the usurpers' power.  </p> <p>Now, standing on the shores of Themis, with allies at your side and enemies unknown lurking across the plains, your quest for allies and answers truly begins...

The island presented a chilling vista: a veritable forest of life-sized marble statues, the vast majority depicting beautiful, naked young men, alongside a grim collection of others, some scarred or maimed. At its heart, a grand marble staircase spiraled down into the earth, beckoning you towards the unknown.</p> <p>With Aella stepping onto her homeland after thirteen years of bitter exile, the air was thick with anticipation and the unspoken weight of her quest to reclaim her birthright. The party, including the knowledgeable warrior Makaira and the Jancan Steros\u2014hopeful of finding his captive father, Bront, within whatever lay below\u2014prepared to delve into the darkness. Delphi, ever cautious, invoked Pass Without Trace for the group, while Aella enhanced his agility with Longstrider.</p> <p>The first test came swiftly. As Delphi began his descent down the marble steps, intending to scout ahead with his re-summoned owl familiar, four of the stoic marble statues flanking the entrance ground to life, their stony silence replaced with hostile intent! A hasty retreat by Delphi caused the guardians to return to their inanimate repose. A chilling discovery followed: a chip Delphi had previously inflicted on a statue was observed to slowly regenerate, the marble magically mending itself.</p> <p>Further investigation revealed a crucial weakness: the golems remained inert when Aella, Rhaena, and Makaira approached, only animating to repel the men of the party, Astraeus and Delphi. While the women could pass, the problem of their male companions remained. Delphi's owl, ghosting past the sealed brass doors at the stairway's nadir, revealed two Amazon warriors within, seemingly at ease, playing cards.</p> <p>Aella dispatched her loyal Stimfay to circle the island's exterior, searching for alternative routes. The clockwork bird returned with two possibilities: a large, half-submerged stone culvert, and a narrow crack in the cliff face, currently at high tide, which might offer passage in a few hours.</p> <p>The party faced a choice: wait for the tide, attempt the culvert which might prove too small for Rhaena, or face the regenerating stone guardians head-on. Impatience and the desire for direct confrontation won out; the golems would be dealt with.</p> <p>Rhaena's initial attempt to topple a golem with ropes proved futile as she stumbled. The battle was joined! The party quickly learned the golem's resilience: they were immune to non-magical weaponry, Rhaena's mundane javelins bouncing harmlessly. Makaira, armed with the magical Spear of Pythor, and Aella, with her enchanted +2 mithral chakram, drew first blood. Astraeus's spells and enchanted arrows from the Shortbow of Cupid found their mark, while Delphi's magic blasted and hindered.</p> <p>The fight became a brutal dance of attrition. The golems struck hard, their marble fists and spear-like protrusions finding their targets, injuring Delphi and Makaira significantly. The key to victory lay in Rhaena's adamantine Nightblade, which carved grievous wounds in the constructs, bypassing their normal defenses and dealing devastating double damage. The party also discovered that dismembering the golems and casting the parts off the cliff\u2014heads, legs\u2014was vital. Though the constructs could still reassemble even when missing parts, removing the head induced blindness, and eventually, the relentless assault and strategic dismemberment proved too much. One by one, the regenerating statues were battered, torn apart, and finally stilled, their magical animation extinguished for good.</p> <p>Victorious but battered, the heroes stood before the now-undefended brass doors. The way into the Amazon's secret temple complex, the heart of the usurpers' domain on Themis, lay open. With the promise of leveling up upon clearing the island, and a short rest needed to recover, the stage is set to plunge deeper into Aella's troubled past and the island's deadly secrets.</p>"},{"location":"friday/recaps/recap_session_28.html","title":"Session 28","text":""},{"location":"friday/recaps/recap_session_28.html#deep-into-the-serpents-den","title":"Deep into the Serpent's Den","text":"<p>Following your brutal victory over the regenerating marble guardians, your party\u2014Aella, Delphi, Rhaena, Astraeus, and the steadfast Makaira, with Kyra diligently recording your exploits\u2014stood at the threshold of the Sacred Temple, the very heart of the usurper queen's power on Themis. The air was thick with the weight of Aella's thirteen-year exile, her quest to reclaim her birthright burning in her eyes.</p> <p>Aella, ever the keen-eyed leader, discerned the secret of the massive bronze door: a rotating mechanism bearing a hand-shaped imprint, a silent invitation to the brave. Through it, you descended into the earth, the pressure building in your ears with each spiraling step.</p> <p>You emerged into a cavernous chamber, the air thick with the musky scent of reptiles. Here, two Amazon warriors stood guard, one methodically sharpening a cleaver, the other pacing. Behind bronze bars, enormous eight-legged basilisks rumbled contentedly, their reptilian eyes a chilling promise of petrification. After a quick respite to recover your strength, you decided against stealth, opting for a decisive strike. Astraeus, with his enchanting charisma, charmed one of the Amazon guards, Talia, turning her heart to his cause. The battle was swift and brutal; Aella, with her enchanted chakram, cut down the dwarf basilisk-keeper Nura and her companion. The monstrous basilisks, now neutralized under hastily thrown sailcloth, snarled in frustration.</p> <p>With Talia charmed and bound, you extracted crucial intelligence. You learned of Commander Lyra, Queen Thesilea VI, and her sister Leia\u2014all dwelling deeper within the complex. You discovered the existence of other prisoners: captured lizardfolk, the giant Jancan blacksmith Bront (Steros's father!), and most importantly, Darien, a childhood friend of Aella's and a high-ranking loyalist to the true queen, imprisoned for thirteen years. Talia also divulged the dark truth behind the marble statues outside: they are the petrified \"favored sons of Lutheria,\" some born here, some shipwrecked, some gifts from afar, and some destined as fodder for the basilisks. You also learned of an underwater entrance, though its exact location remained a mystery. The fallen Amazon warriors were disposed of, tossed over the cliff, their bodies carried away by the waves, unwittingly taking vital keys with them.</p> <p>Leaving the lovestruck Talia (gagged and bound to prevent her alerting anyone to your presence) behind, you proceeded deeper. The next bronze door proved a stubborn challenge, its lock resisting Aella's initial attempts. Even with Stimfay sent to scour the cliff face for Nura's discarded keys (a futile search), Aella's persistent lockpicking eventually yielded.</p> <p>Beyond, a honeycomb-like tunnel reeked of stagnant water. Your heightened senses detected a subtle trap plate. As Aella cautiously investigated, thick, serpentine hydra heads erupted from the holes in the walls, snapping venomously! Aella narrowly evaded their lethal bites. Realizing the danger, Astraeus raced back to Talia, charming her once more to glean the password: \"By the Grace of Lutheria.\" Whispering the blasphemous phrase, you felt a chilling resonance of Lutheria's power, a sickening echo of past nightmares, but the monstrous heads retreated, allowing passage.</p> <p>Navigating around more hidden trap plates, you discovered a side passage leading to the Amazon Barracks. Astraeus, peeking in, confirmed two more Amazon warriors inside, idly playing cards. Without hesitation, you burst in. Rhaena's longsword carved down one warrior, while Aella's chakram, in a brutal arc, decapitated the other. Among the spoils, you found a necklace heavy with keys!</p> <p>These keys opened the final, formidable door in the barracks, revealing a grim sight: a hallway lined with prison cells. Two lizardfolk prisoners pleaded for rescue, revealing their loyalty to Queen Vytha and mentioning the cyclops Bront's capture.</p> <p>But the true revelation lay in the last cell: a young woman, scarred and silent. Recalling Talia's earlier mention of a high-ranking loyalist named Darien held prisoner for her allegiance to the true queen, Aella addressed the unresponsive figure. Despite Aella's impassioned revelation of her own true identity and her denouncement of the medusa usurpers' treachery, the woman remained eerily silent. Delphi, however, with his keen senses, noticed a peculiar acoustic anomaly in her cell, a subtle disturbance suggesting a magical silence was at play. With a final turn of a hard-won key, Aella opened Darien's cell. As the iron grated open, the young woman finally looked up, her eyes wide with a mixture of nervousness and fear.</p>"},{"location":"friday/recaps/recap_session_29.html","title":"Session 29","text":"<p>Alright heroes, gather 'round and let's relive the blood, stone, and secrets from our last descent into the serpent's den!</p> <p>Our session began in the grim aftermath of your brutal takedown of the Amazonian guards.

With the rescue of Aella's childhood friend and cousin-in-spirit, your infiltration transformed into the first true strike to reclaim a stolen throne. After freeing the captive lizardfolk, Skal and Veth, you cleverly turned the enemy's prison against them, silencing the charmed Amazon guard Talia within the very cell that had held Darian for thirteen long years.</p> <p>While looting the barracks, you uncovered a trove of treasure and strange curiosities: adamantine daggers, platinum pieces, a sailor's map hinting at dangers on other isles, and a grim necklace made from a single, gnarled fingernail.

A demon of trouble and boredom, she was amused by your quest for revenge and offered a poisoned chalice of information, pointing you toward the bedchamber of Leia, one of the medusa usurpers.</p> <p>Following her directions past a hidden trap plate, you arrived at a gilded door. Inside, a scene of cloying decadence: Leia, clad in silk, lounging on a bed with a powerful minotaur, serenaded by the maenad musician you now hold prisoner. The unsettling cries of infants echoed from a cradle in the corner.</p> <p>The ambush was perfect. You burst in with the fury of a storm, Aella's chakram screaming for vengeance as it found its mark on Leia. Astraeus bathed the room in Faerie Fire, Rhaena's spear skewered the minotaur, and Delphi's magic tore through the chamber. But your triumph was cut short by a horrifying turn. As the battle was joined, Leia unleashed her petrifying gaze. In a heartbeat, Astraeus and Delphi were turned to cold, unmoving stone! The \"infants\" in the cradle revealed their true form as goatling tricksters, one of whom transformed the mighty Makaira into a helpless rat.</p> <p>Just as disaster seemed imminent, Delphi, in his final moment of flesh and blood, unleashed a devastating, maximized bolt of lightning from a hard-won scroll. The blast incinerated Leia and one of the goatlings, breaking the polymorph spell on Makaira and turning the tide of battle for good. With their leader reduced to a charred husk, the remaining foes quickly surrendered.</p> <p>With the immediate threat neutralized, you used your last two precious doses of basilisk salve to restore your petrified friends. To secure your future, you marched back to the pens, butchered the remaining basilisks, and with skilled hands, harvested a fresh supply of the life-saving remedy.</p> <p>Now, with one sister vanquished and her chambers looted for maps and mysterious potions, you stand victorious but keenly aware of your depleted resources. Your quest for vengeance has just begun, and the true queen of the Amazons still sits on her venomous throne deeper in the complex.

As Queen Thessalia performed her profane rites to Lutheria, a single, spectral hand reached out and ripped the platinum helmet from her head, and a torrent of snakes erupted for all to see! Accusations flew\u2014Thessalia blamed you for a magical trick, while Aella and Darian revealed the truth of the coup that happened thirteen years prior. Darian's impassioned speech, empowered by Astraeus's magic, struck a chord with the Amazon warriors, who stood down in their confusion, refusing to fight for either side.</p> <p>The battle was joined! Thessalia fought with the fury of a cornered snake, creating illusory duplicates of herself and unleashing a petrifying gaze that began to turn Delphi to stone. But you were relentless. Your combined assault shattered her illusions, and Delphi fought off the petrification with a successful save. When her last loyal attendant tried to heal her, Delphi's quick thinking with a Counterspell sealed her fate. Bested and broken, the queen offered surrender, but Aella denied mercy to her mother's murderer. In a final act of defiance, Queen Thessalia took her own life, her green blood staining the temple floor.</p> <p>Though the tyrant is dead, the fight for the throne is not over.

With the fate of the cursed centaurs resting on your shoulders, a choice had to be made.</p> <p>With courage befitting a Dragonlord, Delphi stepped forward. Tying a rope around his waist as a lifeline to his friends, he plunged into the temporal chaos. For him, the world dissolved into a dizzying blur of madly spinning suns and stars. For you, he simply vanished. Following his ghostly trail, the rest of you braved the field, reuniting before a door that had mysteriously appeared in the tower's obsidian face.</p> <p>The path led not to a monster's lair, but to a place far more unsettling: a nursery. Here, dozens of children\u2014human, elf, minotaur\u2014played amongst the discarded armor and weapons of their former lives, their minds wiped clean, their bodies de-aged by the tower's cruel mistress. They warned you of the \"flower lady's\" disappointment with uninvited guests and urged you to climb to the summit to face her with respect.</p> <p>Your ascent was a journey through wonders and horrors.

The fate of your quest, and your very minds, rested on the answer.</p> <p>After a tense deliberation, pooling your fragmented memories and trusting Kyra's knowledge of the stars, you spoke the names: Sydon and Lutheria. A brilliant flash from the hieroglyphs confirmed your victory! Emboldened, you gambled on a fourth question for a bonus favor and won again, correctly naming the titan Talius as the creator of the Myrmekes.</p> <p>Having proven your worth, the Sphinx opened her mind to you, a fount of ancient secrets. She revealed the path to Astraeus's grimoire, hidden on the dangerous Isle of Yonder. For Delphi and Rhaena, she refused to unnaturally age their dragon eggs, but offered a greater gift: a promise to oversee their hatching, to bring forth not mere wyrmlings, but powerful young dragons. But her counsel came with harsh truths; she scornfully dismissed a plea for the centaurs, revealing their curse was an eternal, and perhaps just, punishment. Her most crucial guidance, however, laid bare the grim choice for the spirit-filled lockbox you carried: to be a butcher, a thief, or a hero.</p> <p>You chose the hero's path. After stepping from the tower's temporal distortion and discovering six days had passed, you returned to the Ultros. Under the eerie light of the astral sky, you performed a solemn ritual to release the souls trapped within the box. One by one, you offered the restless spirits the peace they were so long denied. Kyra's lament gave voice to their sorrow, Astraeus's epic poetry promised them remembrance, Delphi's prayer guided them to the afterlife, Rhaena's paladin's oath gave them justice, and Aella's warrior's salute granted them honor.</p> <p>The ritual was a triumph. As the last of the Gygans, Amazons, and Centaurs faded into the moonlight, their rage finally quieted, the oppressive cold lifted. And there, inside the now-silent box, nestled in a fine, silvery dust, was your final prize: a magnificent, opalescent silver dragon egg, which began to pulse with a warm, living light.</p> <p>Now, with three dragon eggs in hand and a course charted by the stars and a sphinx's wisdom, you prepare to return to the tower.

Your infiltration plan, a daring underwater approach, was initiated. Haribo, shrouded in invisibility and transformed into a bat, scouted ahead.</p> <p>Your aerial reconnaissance revealed the grim heart of duergar industry. At the docks, you saw a slow duergar barge, a drow yacht, and, ominously, Valandor's own speedboat, the Night-Talon . Inside the foundry's main level, you glimpsed off-duty workers and, more disturbing, the gruesome assembly of ** Screamers**, with duergar being forced into metallic suits by a grim priest and master smith. You even overheard workers grumbling about Valandor, referring to him as \"the drow prisoner, the artificer,\" and hinting that \"they finally broke the prisoner today\". The Peepers, the foundry's anti-invisibility constructs, also lurked, a threat to your stealth.</p> <p>Descending to the moonpool, you surfaced in a warm, humid cavern, the thrumming of the massive turbine deafening. Your first target: a deceptively cozy cottage on the sub-level. Bentham, still in his natural form, led the way, ambushing Alyxina Fire-Beard ** , the researcher's wife, as she cooked. After a brief interrogation, Malagar, with brutal efficiency, slit her throat** , and Bentham dragged the body into a nearby storage room, which was then looted for supplies and spare parts. Haribo, meanwhile, befriended Alyxina's pet cave spider, Skitter, by offering it fresh rat blood.</p> <p>Next, you moved to the upper level of the cottage, where Chief Researcher Korvun worked in his study. Bentham, now shape-shifted into Alyxina's form, attempted a deception, introducing the party as \"college friends\". Though Korvun was suspicious, the ruse held long enough for the ambush. Ramon paralyzed him with Hold Person, and Haribo poisoned him with spores. While Zyntra accidentally triggered an alarm by failing to disarm a trap on a locked chest, Korvun, under duress, finally revealed the location of Valandor: imprisoned upstairs, behind a heavy adamantine door ** requiring special \"rods of unlocking\" held by the three foundry bosses. As the information was extracted, Zyntra disarmed the alarm and the chest's gas trap. With a final, chilling act, Bentham ** executed Korvun, delivering a parting taunt about his murdered wife.</p> <p>From Korvun's hidden chest, you secured invaluable finds: three D\u00fbmril Ingots ** (Black Mithril) stamped with the ancient Auldbaern symbol, proving their origin in the royal catacombs; a ** Prototype Resonance Lens , capable of detecting thoughts; and a damning letter from ** Director Koldar** (sealed with House Glutthraz wax) demanding increased Screamer output, confirming your rivals' deep involvement. You also found a manual on \"Transmutation\" and a note hinting at the \"Deep-Spire map\" for the true source of D\u00fbmril.</p> <p>With Korvun and Alyxina silenced, the truth of Valandor's fate is clearer than ever: he is alive, albeit imprisoned, and his research is central to the horrific Screamer project. You now possess the means to potentially stop this grim production, armed with critical intelligence and samples of the very Black Mithril that fuels the duergar's monstrous creations.

What followed was not a battle, but a systematic, chilling purge.</p> <p>Your cottage became a slaughterhouse disguised as a sanctuary. One by one, you lured the foundry's personnel to their doom. First, the unsuspecting guard, Borland Emberback , drawn in by Bentham's flawless imitation of the now-dead Alyxina crying \"fire!\" He walked into a dark kitchen and was met not with smoke, but with a waiting storm of steel. His death was swift, his keys now yours.</p> <p>With calculated precision, you turned this trick into a gruesome production line.

The entire sub-level and its overlooking mezzanine are under your control, the bodies of your enemies stuffed into closets and crates. You stand in the heart of the enemy's operation, a mountain of corpses behind you and a wealth of intelligence in your hands. But your path forward is blocked by a colossal, roaring turbine, spinning with deadly speed. Before you lies a choice: do you risk manipulating the complex machinery to grant you passage, or do you dare to unleash the raging, imprisoned elemental and ride the wave of chaos that follows?

Andrew and Kain publicly challenged the cult's motives and connection to Sydon's storm. This caused unrest among the citizens and led the cultists to abandon their post and supplies.  </li> <li>Wine Barrel Clue: Investigated the abandoned wine barrel and identified it (via Tharok's knowledge) as bearing the official seal of the Lutherian wine cartel.  </li> <li>Wine Warehouse Arrival: Reached the wine warehouse. Initial attempts at deception by Kain (disguised as a cultist) were unsuccessful.  </li> <li>Information Gathering: Overheard workmen discussing The Siren's Roost brothel and its expensive \"companions\" (including one claiming to be daughter of a Nereid). Kain and Nicandros used this to befriend the workmen with fake coupons, learning about their supervisor, Epimelites Malachor.  </li> <li>Meeting with Malachor: Spoke with Epimelites Malachor, the warehouse supervisor.  </li> <li>Warehouse Cargo: Learned that the warehouse transports not just wine, but also \"new converts,\" \"slaves,\" and \"kidnapped children.\"  </li> <li>The Ledger: Gained access to and stole Malachor's ledger (Tharok, with Rhy-At's help). The ledger shows a cyclical pattern of shipments of \"small casks,\" indicating they are frequently delivered to the main Temple of Lutheria. This reinforces the suspicion that children are being transported in these casks.  </li> <li>Colossus of Pythor: Decided to investigate the Colossus of Pythor. Found a heavily locked door at the base.  </li> <li>Breaking In: Used a combination of immense strength (Tharok and Zephyrion, now Large size with increased Strength), lockpicking attempts (Kain), and magical force (Andrew's Eldritch Blast) to break open the reinforced door.  </li> <li>Guardian Golems: Encountered two marble golems guarding the entrance. Discovered they can reassemble themselves after being destroyed. Attempted to delay reassembly by scattering their pieces.  </li> <li>Lady of Coins' Minions: Entered the Colossus and encountered several minotaurs and a gladiator lady, who identified themselves as serving the Lady of Coins (their target for Lord Taran's bounty).  </li> <li>Combat Initiated: Combat began after attempts at parley failed and the party used a blinding flash (Andrew) on some of the enemies.  </li> <li>Combat Status: </li> <li>Riot used a spell to restrain two minotaurs.  </li> <li>The Minotaur Hero released green gas into the room, poisoning several party members (failed Constitution saves).  </li> <li>Nicandros Hasted Tharok and Zephyrion.  </li> <li>Kain, Tharok, and Andrew dealt significant damage, defeating one minotaur.  </li> <li>Zephyrion pursued the gladiator lady who fled upstairs, grappling her and throwing her back down the stairs, dealing damage.  </li> <li>The gladiator lady is wounded but still mobile and has escaped further up the staircase.  </li> <li>Combat is ongoing.</li> </ul> <p>The session concluded mid-fight inside the Colossus of Pythor.

Rhy-At recalled that Queen Vallus's water treatment operations were down here and had been experiencing issues since the hurricane.  </li> <li>Kain scouted east, noticing a large shape moving under the deeper water which disappeared quickly. He failed to track it. He also spotted small, tentacle-like larval growths burrowed into the walls, which reacted to his presence. Andrew Lynx used Acid Splash to clear these growths.    </li> <li>Kain scouted further east and observed a giant rat being snatched by a large tentacle/limb from the water. He also spotted more larval growths.    </li> <li>The party engaged and killed a large tentacled creature (Otyugh?) that emerged. They decided against harvesting the carcass.  </li> <li>Kain scouted again, finding a sewer exit leading to the Mytros shipyards near the docks, but not near the Moist Maiden's usual berth.

The water level began to gradually decrease.  </li> <li>The party noted claw marks on the sluice gate and a large, damaged sewer pipe in the chamber.  </li> <li>Rhy-At contemplated an \"acid wash\" of the room, a task reminiscent of his temple duties, but the party decided to wait for the water to drain.  </li> <li>Kain scouted through a sluice gate, discovering an area with tiered water levels, and encountered a Grick creature, remaining undetected due to his invisibility. The party later engaged and killed this Grick.  </li> <li>There was discussion and manipulation of multiple sluice gates to control water flow, aiming to make areas traversable or expose hidden threats.  </li> <li> <p>The Organ and the Beast:</p> </li> <li> <p>The party discovered a chamber with an ornate organ.  </p> </li> <li>Tharok began to play the organ.

It gives +2 AC, +1 spell save DC, +1 spell attack rolls, and 1d6 hit points on successful saving throws against spells. It requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard.  </li> <li>The Wand of Switch Step allows for instantaneous position exchange of allies/enemies. It has 1d4 charges, regains 1d4 at dawn, and has a 1 in 20 chance to vanish if all charges are expended.  </li> <li>The Tome of Harmonious Thought gives +1 to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma (permanently, once per 100 years per person).  </li> </ul> </li> <li>They initially chose the Robe of the Weave and the Wand of Switch Step. Nikandros expressed interest in the Robe of the Weave due to its healing on saving throws. The party decided the Wand of Switch Step would be good for Nikandros due to its action cost and battlefield control.  </li> <li>The Queen also subtly warned them not to bring the Ultros (the ancestor's ship) back to her husband, King Acastus, as he has other plans and is trying to use them. Andrew Lynx knew Astor Archelander (King Acastus's ancestor) was a bloodthirsty dragon lord.  </li> <li>Hero's Feast and Shopping Spree: </li> <li>The party decided to take a long rest and eat dinner at the palace, which granted them the benefits of a Hero's Feast.  </li> <li>The Hero's Feast cured diseases (like Tharok's sewer plague), granted immunity to poison and frightened conditions for 24 hours, advantage on Wisdom saving throws, and an increase in hit point maximum by 2d10 (Tharok rolled 15 extra HP).  </li> <li>After the feast, they went to the dive bar (Satyrs' Tail) where Tharok had previously arm-wrestled.  </li> <li>Tharok bought drinks for everyone (20 gold).  </li> <li>Zephyrion flirted with the satyr-human hybrid barmaid, Lyra.  </li> <li>Tharok challenged the minotaur (whom he previously defeated) to a drinking contest. The minotaur was \"cowed\" and agreed to a friendly wager of 5 gold pieces.  </li> <li>Nikandros played his harp (borrowing Tharok's magical instrument) and conjured squirrels to re-enact their sewer fight, impressing the crowd and earning 50 gold pieces.  </li> <li>Kain (the spy) met with his contact, Sari the Knight, at the bar. Sari provided three rumors for 50 gold pieces each (total 150 gp):  <ul> <li>Queen Thessalia wears a full helm because no one may look on her divine beauty.  </li> <li>A hidden bay on the east coast of the Isle of Themis is choked with rocks, but an underwater tunnel leads to it.  </li> <li>The Amazons have mutated and trained a giant hydra to guard their underground lair, devouring anyone who enters.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>They then went to Talia's shop for supplies.  </li> <li>Tharok signed a potion for Talia as an \"endorsement\".  </li> <li>They tried to sell monster parts (cobold eggs, maw teeth). Tharok gave two kobold eggs to Vulcan and Pyra as gifts for future apprentices, keeping one for himself.  </li> <li>They purchased:  <ul> <li>Two Superior Healing Potions for each of the 6 party members (12 total), at a discounted price due to Talia's appreciation for their fame. Initial price 330 gp each, total 3960 gp.  </li> <li>Elixirs of Health (300 gp each, cures diseases/conditions). They bought two, making the total spend 3960 + 600 \\= 4560 gp.  </li> <li>One Oil of Sharpness (320 gp).  </li> <li>Five Potions of Heroism (one for each except Tharok).  </li> </ul> </li> <li>They sold various items:  <ul> <li>Silver ring (Coil of the Eternal Serpent) for 100 gold. This ring provides 1d6 poison damage on piercing/slashing attacks, advantage on saves vs. poison, a bonus action to coat weapon for 2d6 extra damage on next hit (once per short rest), and allows speaking with snakes/serpentine creatures. It requires attunement.  </li> <li>Fine jade figurine for 275 gold (negotiated up from 200).  </li> <li>Finely crafted music box for 250 gold. It casts Soothing Lullaby (Calm Emotions) once per day.  </li> <li>Six Hematite Spheres for 900 gold (150 each).  </li> <li>Mithril Short Sword +1 and Scale Mail Armor with serpent. These were likely sold, though specific prices aren't immediately clear from the transcript.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>They opted to keep the Scarab of Protection in party loot (provides +1 to all saves, advantage on saves vs. spells, 12 charges to force succeed on necromancy/undead effects).  </li> <li>Travel to the Mithril Forge and New Revelations: </li> <li>The party decided to go directly to the Mithril Forge, delaying the Ultros quest.  </li> <li>They chose to travel on The Swift Dawn with Captain Ione Stormwind for 225 gold (negotiated down from 240, after initially being 120 and then 240 to increase speed). Nikandros playing his harp allowed them to get 7 mph speed.  </li> <li>The travel took 4 hours.  </li> <li>They arrived at the Mithril Forge around 2 PM.  </li> <li>Mage Hand was used to pull the lever and open the waterfall entrance.  </li> <li>At the forge, Pyra and Vulcan had been doing remodeling.  </li> <li>Pyra presented them with the Cloak of Magic Immunity as their first commission. This cloak allows the wearer to spend charges (equal to spell's level) as a reaction to become immune to a spell's effects, regaining all charges daily.  </li> <li>Vulcan revealed a Calydonian , a messenger construct from the old days, found during clearing ruins.  </li> <li>To repair the Calydonian, Vulcan needs two Mithril ingots and 1000 gold pieces.  </li> <li>The party immediately provided the Mithril (from a Mithril-inlaid axe and other Mithril items) and the 1000 gold pieces. Once repaired (in 3 days), the Calydonian can deliver commissioned items and collected materials directly to the party anywhere, saving travel time.  </li> <li>Vulcan also presented Tharok with a Baby Basilisk companion (named \"Baby Bjorn\" or \"Bjorn\" after Tharok's axe), which will grow over time with feeding and care. It's a small creature that starts with a PB of 2.  </li> <li>Tharok also decided to give two of his kobold eggs to Vulcan and Pyra as gifts, for them to raise as apprentices. He kept one for himself.  </li> <li>The Wyvern egg they possess is expected to hatch in about 5 days.</li> </ol> <p>Current Status of the Party:</p> <ul> <li>Healed from Sewer Plague.  </li> <li>Received two powerful magic items: Robe of the Weave (Nikandros) and Wand of Switch Step.  </li> <li>Received the Cloak of Magic Immunity.  </li> <li>Commissioned the repair of the Calydonian messenger construct, providing the materials.  </li> <li>Tharok has a new baby basilisk companion (Baby Bjorn).  </li> <li>They are well-stocked with healing potions, elixirs of health, and potions of heroism.  </li> <li>They are currently at the Mithril Forge.  </li> <li>Their next major decision is whether to immediately pursue the Ultros (as Queen Vallus secretly instructed) or return to Sour Vintage for more rumors (as she publicly suggested) before going for the ship..

Arrows flew, blades flashed, and Demetrius's mocking words seared their twisted hearts. Sostrate's rescue was swift and decisive, and Corinna's reunion with her friend brought a spark of hope amidst the gloom.  </li> <li>Strange plants revived your spirits, and a meeting with Melenthe, the friendly dryad, gifted you magical wine and dire warnings of Demetria's fall from grace. Even the fey were wary of the vengeful dryad's growing power.

The plates held food that could transform them into monstrous maenads. With split-second decisions, Kain cast entangle, trapping Demetria, her gygan companion, and two of the girls.  </li> <li>Ari rushed forward, scattering the plates to save the innocent. Tharok and Zephyrion launched ferocious attacks, felling the gygan with heroic blows. Meanwhile, Kalian unleashed radiant magic, and Demetrius's vicious whispers unraveled Demetria's composure.  </li> <li>Facing the might of your combined strength, Demetria surrendered, offering a potion to reverse the maenads' transformation and swearing to change her ways. Her hatred for Estor Arkelander burned deep, and Ari shared her vow to one day slay the dragonlord who had wronged them both. Victory and Questions </li> <li>The Horn of Balmytria is yours! Its legendary power awaits, but so too does the question of Demetria's fate. Will you trust her promises of reform or take a harder path? Corinna and her rescued friends offer gratitude and speak of rewards waiting at her father's vineyard in Estoria.  </li> <li>Ahead lies the Mithral Forge, brimming with ancient potential, but the shadow of the full moon and the looming threat of Estor's Rock cast a dark pall over your triumphs.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"wednesday/logs/log_session_9.html","title":"Session 9","text":"<p>Epic Path Reminders</p> <ul> <li>Ariasia (\"Ari\"), The Lost One:   You've learned that the key to finding your way home lies in the lost treasure of the Dragonlords .

Rhy-At shielded himself with illusory duplicates while Tharok, fueled by rage and Nicandros's haste, relentlessly pressed the attack against the gas-releasing minotaur.

Andrew Lynx's arcane blasts sought targets, while Zephyrion contended with the surprisingly resilient gladiator lady who had managed to break free from his crushing grapple, only to be struck down again by his swift reaction.</p> <p>Tharok's mighty axe finally silenced the Minotaur Hero, whose dying breath cursed you for slaying their \"savior.\" Facing the imposing minotaur alone, the remaining warrior, Kragnos, surrendered under Tharok's fierce intimidation. With the immediate threat subdued, Tharok closed the hissing valve, stopping the flow of poison, and Zephyrion quickly applied the Mithral Thread bandages purchased from Talia, miraculously purging the lingering poison from Kain's system. A quick search yielded coin, gems, and gear from the fallen foes, including a vial of noxious sludge Kragnos identified simply as \"shit.\" Tharok allowed the defeated minotaur to depart, warning him away.</p> <p>Pressing upwards, you passed through chambers filled with more strange machinery \u2013 an acidic-smelling torso room (C4) and a chest chamber (C5) housing a massive furnace heart. Here, thugs and other shady figures played cards, interrupting their game to eye your party warily. A watchful drow demanded a password, but Tharok, thinking quickly, bluffed passage by invoking Kragnos's name and mentioning a need to see \"Moxina\" about lucrative business, a gamble that surprisingly paid off.</p> <p>Ascending finally into the head of the Colossus (C6), you found yourselves in the lair of the Lady of Coins herself. The Medusa, Moxena, lounged amidst lifelike statues \u2013 her petrified victims \u2013 under the eerie glow of a central control orb. A tense negotiation began. Confronting her about her trafficking operations for the dragon Hexia and her ties to the Isle of Themis, Moxena revealed fragmented truths about her business and her exiled Amazonian sisters. Offers and counter-offers flew: her demand for Lord Neurdagon's head, your refusal, her offer to join your voyage if you helped her against her sisters. After much deliberation and a masterful persuasion by the party, a deal was struck. Moxena would cease her criminal activities in Mytros and aid you on your journey after you leave the city, meeting you via her contacts near the Satyr's Tail. In return, you agreed to help her confront her usurper sisters on Themis, leaving Lord Neurdagon out of the arrangement for now. Satisfied, she permitted you to leave, requesting only that you fix the door you destroyed on your way out.</p> <p>Before departing the Colossus entirely, you chose to investigate the alternate passage downward from the belly chamber \u2013 the Colossus's other leg. Descending a makeshift ladder, you entered the foul-smelling Mytros sewers. Rhy-At recalled this area housed the city's waterworks, known to be malfunctioning since Sydon's storm. Kain scouted ahead through the muck, spotting strange larval growths on the walls (which Andrew subsequently destroyed with Acid Splash) and glimpsing a large, unidentified creature moving beneath the murky water before it vanished. Moments later, a giant rat was snatched from the path by a massive tentacle-like limb erupting from the sludge. An Otyugh-like monstrosity emerged, which the party swiftly dispatched.

Your daring infiltration of the Colossus of Pythor culminated in a tense bargain with Moxena, the Lady of Coins ** , leader of the Thieves' Guild known as the \"Cult of the Snake.\"** With an agreement struck to aid her against her sisters on Themis in exchange for her ceasing criminal operations in Mytros, you descended from the mechanical titan's leg into the stinking, malfunctioning sewers beneath the city \u2013 a realm Rhy-At knew housed the city's troubled waterworks. After a brief skirmish with an Otyugh-like horror, you pressed on into the unknown depths.</p> <p>The Descent into Foul Waters:</p> <p>Your sewer exploration quickly became a hands-on lesson in ancient plumbing. Cautiously approaching a sluice gate, Nicandros ** , with a clever use of Mage Hand, unleashed a torrent, gradually draining a vast chamber. Ominous claw marks on the gate hinted at unseen dangers. While Rhy-At** considered a full \"acid wash\" of the massive room (a familiar chore from his temple days!), the party opted to wait for the waters to recede.</p> <p>Investigations revealed a colossal, damaged sewer pipe. The ever-vigilant Kain scouted ahead through another sluice, navigating a treacherous system of tiered water levels. It was here, cloaked in invisibility, that he first sensed it \u2013 a \"Grick\" creature, sniffing the air but failing to pinpoint the hidden ranger.</p> <p>An Organ of Ill Omen and a Worm from the Depths:</p> <p>The dank tunnels eventually opened into a chamber dominated by a peculiar, ornate organ. Tharok , never shy of experimentation, sat down to play. His initial haunting notes soon gave way to a cacophony as he pressed multiple keys, unleashing a disgusting blast of \"poo vapors\" that even his sturdy minotaur constitution barely withstood! Undeterred, Tharok's bizarre symphony continued, and from the echoing depths of the sewer, a gigantic, wailing, guttural roar answered his call.</p> <p>The music disturbed more than just the air. In a nearby chamber, the waters began to froth and churn violently. Suddenly, a massive, slimy tentacle erupted, lashing out at the startled Kain ** and ** Rhy-At ! Combat was joined as the dreaded ** Plague Worm** surfaced!</p> <p>The battle was a desperate struggle in the muck and mire. Rhy-At ** unleashed potent Mind Slivers and a scorching, empowered Fireball. ** Kain , a blur of motion, peppered the beast with arrows, his attempt to ensnare it with a net proving futile as the worm's bulk shredded it. The goddess ** Kyra , taking refuge on ** Zephyrion's ** broad back, offered divine encouragement while ** Andrew Lynx pummeled the monstrosity with relentless Eldritch Blasts.</p> <p>The Plague Worm fought back with terrifying ferocity, its Tentacular Tongue grappling heroes and its Putrid Bile spewing forth in a sickening wave. Zephyrion ** , after Nicandros** freed a comrade by blasting a tentacle apart with necrotic energy from his mace, charged into the fray. He landed mighty blows with his Kopis and the chilling Trident of Kenta-Mean, but the worm's retaliatory strike was devastating, and Zephyrion fell unconscious into the filth!</p> <p>Seeing his companion fall, Kain ** channeled the divine power of the Radiance of Mytros sword, its holy light bringing Zephyrion back to his feet, albeit bloodied. The heroes pressed their advantage, weathering the worm's legendary resistances. Finally, grievously wounded, the Plague Worm turned to flee, slithering beneath the murky surface. But ** Kain, enraged, gave chase. Vanishing into the shadows, he unleashed a final, perfectly aimed volley of three arrows, striking true and felling the grotesque beast!</p> <p>Treasures, Tortured Poultry, and Troublesome Thugs:</p> <p>In the aftermath, Kain ** grimly beheaded the bloated corpse. Sifting through its vile innards, ** Rhy-At ** made a startling discovery: the remains of a ** Thieves' Guild ** member and an ornate chest.

Administering a thimbleful of both potions simultaneously resulted in a chaotic, grotesque transformation. The poor bird began to wildly expand and contract, different parts growing and shrinking at random, all while squawking in what could only be described as poultry anguish.

Kain's skilled hands made short work of the lock. However, as he pulled the door open, a beefy goblin appeared, promptly slammed it shut, and relocked it! Not to be deterred, Kain picked the lock again, this time with the party ready for action.

The hideout was secured, its alarm unrung.</p> <p>Looting the fallen yielded some coin, a tarnished silver serpent ring (another nod to the Thieves' Guild), and an amulet from the goblin boss. Yet another locked door stood before you. Kain , proving himself the master of unlocking, opened it to a startling sight: a rather skanky-looking human woman, Lydia, and another goblin boss, mid-embrace!</p> <p>Interrupted and clearly flustered, the pair prepared for a fight. Rhy-At ** was first to act, slicing the woman's mind with a Mind Sliver. ** Zephyrion , leaping dramatically over his comrades, charged the goblin boss, felling him with two brutal throws of his trident. The terrified Lydia, now alone, was subjected to questioning by a sewer-stench-covered ** Kain . She confirmed that you had indeed stumbled into a hideout of the ** Thieves' Guild (the \"Cult of the Snake\").</p> <p>A Cliffhanger Deception:</p> <p>The session concluded on a razor's edge. Another door remained, behind which more Guild members were undoubtedly alerted. A desperate, convoluted plan was hatched: Lydia, thoroughly intimidated by Tharok ** and the still-twitching bag containing Henrietta's remains, was coerced into approaching the door. ** Rhy-At ** even offered his skills in disguise. Lydia knocked, nervously uttered the password (\"avocado!\"). A slot opened, and a suspicious voice questioned her. Her quavering response immediately raised alarms. Thinking fast, ** Tharok boomed that they were associates of Moxena, the Lady of Coins, and had just saved Lydia from the monstrous Plague Worm, brandishing its severed head as undeniable proof!</p> <p>The Guild members on the other side, though confused by the sight of the gruesome trophy, sternly ordered you to step back from the door\u2026</p> <p>And that's where the darkness, and the session, closed!

Through eloquent persuasion (and perhaps a bit of well-placed flattery!), the party convinced her to grant them two of these legendary items: the versatile Wand of Switch Step and the incredibly potent Robe of the Weave. Yet, with the rewards came a hushed, critical warning: DO NOT deliver King Acastus's coveted Ultros to him, as his obsession with glory risks the ship falling into the wrong hands.</p> <p>After indulging in a well-deserved Hero's Feast at the palace, curing Tharok's sewer plague and bolstering their very life force , the heroes ventured into the seedy Satyrs' Tail bar. Nikandros wowed the crowd with a mesmerizing performance, conjuring squirrels to re-enact their recent sewer battle, earning a tidy sum . Meanwhile, Kain's contacts proved invaluable, as Sari the Knight divulged crucial rumors about Queen Thessalia, a hidden underwater tunnel leading to Themis, and even a monstrous, mutated Hydra guarding the Amazons' lair .</p> <p>The next morning, after a productive shopping spree for vital potions and gear, the party booked passage on</p> <p>The Swift Dawn, a speedy riverboat captained by the no-nonsense Captain Stormwind . Nikandros's bardic prowess once again shone, conjuring a perfect tailwind with his harp and reducing their travel time to a mere four hours.</p> <p>Upon arrival at the Mithral Forge, a place bustling with activity and the clang of hammers, the party used a clever</p> <p>Mage Hand to open the secret waterfall entrance. Inside, they were greeted by Pyra and Vulcan, the divine smiths themselves! Pyra presented their first commission: the</p> <p>Cloak of Magic Immunity, an extraordinary garment capable of rendering its wearer immune to hostile spells .</p> <p>But the surprises didn't end there! Vulcan unveiled a damaged yet magnificent construct, a</p> <p>Calydonian messenger from ancient times . For a thousand gold pieces and two Mithril ingots (generously provided by the party from their own stash!), this majestic flying courier will soon be repaired, capable of delivering items and materials directly to them, wherever their adventures may lead . And to top it all off, Tharok received an unexpected and adorable new companion:</p> <p>Baby Bjorn, a baby basilisk, now his responsibility to nurture and feed !</p> <p>The journey continues, with powerful artifacts in hand, a loyal new companion, and a flying messenger on the way, the heroes are more ready than ever to face the trials ahead!</p>"},{"location":"wednesday/recaps/recap_session_27.html#-","title":"---","text":""},{"location":"wednesday/recaps/recap_session_28.html","title":"Session 28 Recap: Whispers of the Dead Falls","text":"<p>07/02/2025</p> <p>Your last session began in the thrumming heat of the Mithral Forge. Armed with newly forged treasures and the promise of the Calydonian Messenger soon to take flight, you received a crucial piece of the puzzle for your resident Dragonslayer. Volkan, the grizzled smith, pulled Kain aside, speaking of weapons forged by Gygans\u2014god-killers\u2014and of a horned scholar named Chondrus who hoards them on the fortified Isle of Yonder. A new, dangerous path revealed itself.</p> <p>With goodbyes said and Tharok taking up the solemn duty of guarding the newly adopted baby basilisk, Bjorn, you began the journey east. A swift river passage gave way to a tense, moonlit trek through the woods. Your approach was anything but subtle, leading you directly into a clearing where a bizarre ritual was underway: a dozen goatlings dancing wildly around an uprooted tree. A tense standoff ensued, with Rhy-At's offering of cheap liquor met with confusion and pan pipes. After shrugging off a boot-full of snakes, Rhy-At's commanding presence, followed by Nikandros's silver-tongued persuasion, not only cowed the creatures but saw you leaving with a Goodberry Tonic for your troubles\u2014a tribute from the intimidated beast-men.</p> <p>You arrived at the Sour Vintage at the ungodly hour of 4:30 AM to a sight both familiar and changed. The tavern, now a monument to your previous heroism, was grander than you remembered. The star-struck stable boy, Marcus, offered Zephyrion the finest stall in the house before you spent the early morning hours exploring the waking town. Zephyrion secured a complimentary hoof-trim and brand-new shoes by recounting his epic deeds, while Rhy-At established a holy shrine to the five gods under a large tree, consecrating the ground.</p> <p>As the tavern came to life, so did the whispers of your destination. You were welcomed with cheers and free drinks, but the mood shifted as you sought information on the Dead Falls. Alexios, a former smuggler, spoke in hushed tones of a partner lost to the falls, of passages that flood without warning, and a ghost ship sighted in a hidden inlet. His words were a chilling omen, though his paranoia didn't stop Kain from haggling him down with masterful skill to acquire a magical Goblin Mask for a steal. More warnings came from Corax the hunter, who spoke of a deathly silence that falls at midnight, of canyon walls that look like screaming faces, and his unnerving certainty that they breathe.</p> <p>Amidst the grim portents, the tavern was alive with character. Zephyrion, in a display of pure, unadulterated confidence, received a... thorough glistening with scented oils from the merchant Philomena. Nikandros brought a smile to the face of the grieving war widow, Margot, over a game of cards, unknowingly earning the ire of a jealous onlooker.</p> <p>You now stand on the precipice, the boisterous life of the Sour Vintage behind you and the chilling, supernatural tales of the Dead Falls echoing in your minds. The path ahead is treacherous, the warnings are dire, and the legendary ghost ship Ultros awaits.</p>"},{"location":"wednesday/recaps/recap_session_28.html#_1","title":"Session 28 Recap: Whispers of the Dead Falls","text":""},{"location":"wednesday/recaps/recap_session_28.html#-","title":"---","text":""},{"location":"wednesday/recaps/recap_session_29.html","title":"Session 29 Recap: Blood on the Black Oak","text":"<p>07/09/2025</p> <p>Your adventure continued as you finally stood before the Dead Falls. After navigating a treacherous, flooded passage, you emerged into a silent, hidden lake where the legendary ghost ship, the * Ultros , awaited. Upon boarding the eerily pristine vessel, Kain touched the central mast and was struck by a vision of the dryad Delphia, whose spirit was bound to the wood when her tree was felled to create it. This act awakened the ship, and you were confronted by its spectral crew and its fearsome captain, Estor Arkelander* .</p> <p>After a tense dialogue where Estor revealed his pact with the \"Lady of Dreams\" (Lutheria) and tasked you with hunting his three \"traitorous\" thanes, you proceeded to the captain's cabin. There, you met the first thane, the ghost of Skaethon . He warned you that Estor\u2019s offer was a trap to possess the strongest among you. Ignoring the warning, Kain initiated combat, and a brutal battle ensued in the cramped quarters.</p> <p>The fight was desperate. Skaethon animated his armor and sword, locked the door to divide you, and proved a formidable foe. [cite_start]During the melee, Andrew Lynx unleashed the power of the Scepter of King Driptongue ** [cite: 1], using its Dark Resonance** ability to infuse the party with necrotic power. This allowed you to make vampiric bite attacks, your eyes glowing black as you drained life from your enemies. Though Skaethon himself was immune to the necrotic drain, Zephyrion bit the animated sword in half, and Tharok bit a specter to death. After both Zephyrion and Tharok were knocked unconscious, Andrew Lynx dealt the final, decisive blow, destroying Skaethon with a barrage of Eldritch Blasts.</p> <p>Aftermath and Discoveries:</p> <p>With Skaethon vanquished, the remaining specters returned to their duties. In the now-quiet cabin, you found: * Skaethon's Legacy ** : His magical suit of sea-motif armor, Azurescale ** , and his dark sword, Ebony , which is now damaged with a distinct bite mark in the blade. * Treasure ** : A chest containing 300 gp, 50 pp, a black pearl, four bloodstones, an ivory siren statue, a silver dragon comb, and three powerful potions: Felix Felicis (Liquid Luck) ** , a Potion of Etherealness ** , and Sandman's Embrace** .</p> <p>Looking Forward:</p> <p>One thane is down, but two remain. Estor Arkelander sits upon his throne on the upper deck, reading a tome titled \"The Ledger of Wills,\" awaiting the outcome of his challenge. You now have confirmation that his offer is a trap for possession. Meanwhile, Rhy-At holds a water-logged journal from a fallen adventurer, its secrets yet unread, and Zephyrion has befriended a mysterious, ghostly gray owl that watches from the rigging. You must now decide how to proceed with Estor's deadly game to claim the Ultros.</p>"}]}
