# Lost Mine of the Drow – Prologue: **The Price of Ambition**

## **CRITICAL TIMELINE FOR DMS AND FUTURE LLMS**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Valandor's Status Timeline - Do NOT Spoil for Players**

### **Campaign Start Status (Session 1):**
- Valandor T'alzar is **ALIVE** and currently on a legitimate research/trade mission to Cinderfork Foundry
- He is actively studying Black Mithril forging techniques with the duergar
- The family expects his successful return with breakthrough discoveries
- **Player Knowledge:** "Valandor is away on important research that could save the house"

### **Early Sessions (Sessions 1-2):**
- Valandor becomes **overdue** - his mission was supposed to conclude but he hasn't returned
- Family grows worried but still hopeful for rescue
- **Player Knowledge:** "Valandor is missing and may need rescue"

### **During Act I (While PCs Travel to Cinderfork):**
- Valandor is **captured, tortured, and murdered** by Glutthraz agents (happens off-screen)
- This occurs concurrently with the PCs' journey - tragic timing
- **Player Knowledge:** Still believes they're on a rescue mission

### **End of Act I (Cinderfork Discovery):**
- PCs discover Valandor's body and learn the truth
- **Dramatic Revelation:** Mission changes from rescue to revenge
- Family devastated, especially young Miraleth who loses her father

### **Acts II-III:**
- Family deals with grief, betrayal, and desperate survival
- Valandor's research becomes their only hope for the future

**DM Note:** This timeline ensures maximum emotional impact. The family's journey from hope to devastation parallels the PCs' mission transformation from rescue to revenge.

## **Core Concept**

> *House T'alzar stands on the edge of obliteration.  In three acts the PCs will lose everything they thought was secure, discover a miracle alloy locked behind ancient secrets, and launch themselves toward the surface world determined to forge a new future—or die in the attempt.*

### **Central Themes:**
- **Hope to Despair:** The family's journey from hopeful expectation of Valandor's return to devastating grief
- **Family vs. Ambition:** The cost of survival in a ruthless political environment
- **Betrayal from Within:** Vyssinia's treachery adds betrayal to the family's grief
- **Protecting the Innocent:** Miraleth becomes the emotional heart representing what they're fighting to save
- **From Rescue to Revenge:** The mission's transformation drives the entire narrative

### **Emotional Stakes:**
- **Miraleth's Innocence:** Her father's death and subsequent trauma
- **Severine's Desperation:** A mother's grief and determination to protect her remaining family
- **Lirael's Burden:** Taking on leadership while processing her brother's murder
- **The Family's Survival:** Their fight to preserve what's left of House T'alzar

## 0. Core Objectives (What this prologue **must** accomplish)

1. **Spotlight the PCs** – showcase their talents, flaws, and team dynamics as elite agents of House T'alzar.
2. **Establish Setting & Tone** – paint Vlyn'darastyl and the Black Loch as a brutal, intrigue‑soaked underdark melting‑pot where power is hoarded and mercy is weakness.
3. **Introduce House T'alzar** – its artificer identity, precarious finances, key family members, and especially young Miraleth as the emotional heart.
4. **Name the Enemy** – House Glutthraz, ruthless bankers‑cum‑resource barons who murder Valandor and intend to crush T'alzar utterly.
5. **Deliver a Devastating Blow** – Valandor's murder transforms hope to grief; by Act II the PCs watch their tower burn, their Matron fall, and a traitor seize control.
6. **Seed Alliances & Neutrals** – Musca myconids, House Vaerixas, House Cull'thaine, Lochborne Maritime Compact (Clan Tideborne), etc.
7. **Point to Wave Echo Cave** – clues prove that *Black Mithril* can only be fully refined in the dwarven *Forge of Spells* on the surface; securing it becomes the House's singular hope.
8. **Hammer Home Emotional Stakes** – Miraleth's protection and the family's survival drive every decision; honoring Valandor's sacrifice becomes their mission.
