At the docks, you saw a slow duergar barge, a drow yacht, and, ominously, **Valandor's own speedboat, the *Night-Talon***. Inside the foundry's main level, you glimpsed off-duty workers and, more disturbing, the gruesome assembly of **Screamers**, with duergar being forced into metallic suits by a grim priest and master smith. You even overheard workers grumbling about Valandor, referring to him as "the drow prisoner, the artificer," and hinting that "they finally broke the prisoner today".
