<h1 id="session-5">Session 5: Confronting the Turbine and the Chief Engineer</h1>
<p>This session picks up with the party in control of the Cinderfork Foundry's sub-level and mezzanine, their path forward blocked by a colossal, high-speed turbine. Their objective is to find a way past this deadly obstacle to reach the upper levels, where Valandor is imprisoned, and to acquire the three Rods of Opening required for his rescue.</p>
<h3 id="scouting-the-controls">Scouting the Controls</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deception and Intel:</strong> The party decided to first secure the turbine's control room (Gear Room). Ravi, disguised as the deceased Chief Researcher Korvun, and Malagar, disguised as a guard, entered the noisy chamber. They found a lone duergar worker, Brack Ironman, performing maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Lever Logic:</strong> Ravi engaged the worker, feigning an inspection and asking about the two large levers in the room. Brack proudly explained their function: one redirected steam pressure to the upper foundry for heating, while the other was an emergency vent to release pressure to the surface. He revealed that pulling both simultaneously would trigger a complete system shutdown, a procedure only performed during scheduled safety tests around midnight—still four hours away.</li>
<li><strong>Eliminating the Witness:</strong> Realizing they couldn't wait, the party decided the worker had to be silenced. While Ravi kept him distracted, Malagar ambushed him with a drow-poisoned rapier. Though the tough duergar survived the initial blow, the party quickly dispatched him and dragged his body to the growing collection in the research cottage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-chief-engineers-last-stand">The Chief Engineer's Last Stand</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Synchronized Breach:</strong> With the Gear Room secured, the party planned their assault on the adjacent Power Distribution Hub, where they believed Chief Engineer Tholdrum—a likely key-holder—was located. The plan was a synchronized breach: Malagar and Zyntra would drop grenades from the mezzanine catwalk above, while the rest of the team stormed the doors.</li>
<li><strong>A Noisy Entrance:</strong> The party took positions and moved in. Despite the overwhelming noise of the foundry giving them a tactical advantage, Clank fumbled his approach, prematurely opening a door and alerting the Chief Engineer.</li>
<li><strong>Explosive Opening:</strong> Reacting instantly, Malagar and Zyntra dropped their grenades. The coordinated explosions were devastating, killing two duergar sentries outright and sending Chief Engineer Tholdrum flying, leaving him wounded and prone.</li>
<li><strong>A Vicious Engagement:</strong> The party capitalized on the surprise. Malagar leaped down from the catwalk, marking Tholdrum with a Hunter's Mark before striking. Ravi and Haribo followed up with attacks of their own. Enraged, Tholdrum used a bonus action to overcharge his massive steam hammer, gaining resistance to nearly all damage. He then unleashed a furious volley on Ravi, knocking the bard unconscious in a single turn. After a quick heal from Haribo, Malagar pressed the attack, finally felling the Chief Engineer with a series of precise strikes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="aftermath-and-the-path-forward">Aftermath and the Path Forward</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Looting the Engineer:</strong> The party looted Tholdrum's body. They recovered his magical <strong>+1 Breastplate</strong>, a <strong>"Bottle of Lightning"</strong> grenade, a bizarre <strong>"Slug Potion"</strong>, and two potent <strong>"Dreamless Deep"</strong> potions capable of inducing a long rest in minutes. However, they made a critical discovery: <strong>Tholdrum did not have one of the Rods of Opening.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Turbine Dilemma:</strong> With the sub-level's command staff eliminated, the party returned to the problem of the turbine. They now know that pulling both levers will shut it down, but it will also trigger a foundry-wide emergency alert. They determined they have a very narrow window: it takes about 90 seconds for the turbine to slow to a crossable speed, but the first responders are expected to arrive in that same timeframe.</li>
</ul>
<p>The session ended with the party contemplating their next move, weighing the risks of a full-frontal assault against the possibility of using the turbine itself as a weapon to lure and eliminate their enemies.</p>
