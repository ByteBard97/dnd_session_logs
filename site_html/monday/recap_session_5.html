<h1 id="session-5-recap-the-engineers-gambit-and-the-silent-turbine">Session 5 Recap: The Engineer's Gambit and the Silent Turbine</h1>
<p>When last we left our ruthless agents of House T'alzar, you were masters of a silent fortress. The sub-level was yours, its former guardians silenced and stacked in closets. But your path forward was blocked by a colossal, roaring turbine, a spinning wall of steel between you and your brother, <strong>Valandor</strong>.</p>
<p>Your next move was a study in brutal efficiency. You targeted the Gear Room, the control hub for the deadly machine. Ravi, cloaked in the guise of the slain Chief Researcher, and Malagar, disguised as a common guard, confronted the lone worker inside. Through clever deception, you learned the secrets of the levers—how to divert the steam, and more importantly, how to trigger a full system shutdown. The worker, having outlived his usefulness, was executed with cold precision, his body added to the growing pile.</p>
<p>With the controls understood, you set your sights on a greater prize: <strong>Chief Engineer Tholdrum</strong>, who you believed held one of the three keys to Valandor’s prison. What followed was a synchronized breach plan. From the catwalks above, Malagar and Zyntra prepared to rain death from above with grenades, while the rest of you prepared to storm the doors.</p>
<p>But no plan survives contact with the enemy—or a clumsy ally. Clank, misreading a cue, burst through the door prematurely, and the room exploded into chaos. Grenades fell, blasting Tholdrum's sentries to pieces and sending the Chief Engineer himself sprawling. You descended upon him, a whirlwind of steel and magic. But Tholdrum was no simple overseer. Enraged, he overcharged his massive steam hammer and, in a single, furious assault, crushed Ravi, leaving him on the brink of death.</p>
<p>It was a desperate fight. But after a quick heal from Haribo, you rallied. Malagar, a blur of motion, unleashed a relentless series of strikes, finally silencing the Chief Engineer in a fountain of his own blood.</p>
<p>You plundered his corpse, claiming his magical armor and a host of strange alchemical potions. But you also made a devastating discovery: Tholdrum did not have the key. The rod you seek is still out of reach.</p>
<p>And so we find you now, standing before the controls of the silent turbine. You have the power to shut it down completely, to create a path forward. But doing so will sound a foundry-wide alarm, bringing the full weight of the duergar down upon you in minutes. You face a terrible choice: Do you risk the shutdown, creating a desperate race against time? Or do you find another, more subtle way to weaponize the very machine that blocks your path? The silence of the sub-level is yours, but time is running out.</p>
