<p><strong>Session 3: Infiltration and Devastation at Cinderfork Foundry</strong></p>
<p>The session began with the party aboard the <em>Silent Keel</em>, a skiff pulled by two monstrous Keelhauler eels, making their 20-hour journey across the Black Loch towards Cinderfork Foundry.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Journey Across the Black Loch:</strong>  </li>
<li>The party settled onto the boat, with some (Rav'ithar) preferring the open deck and others (Clank) seeking a "moldy corner" below.  </li>
<li>Malagar successfully used Insight to understand Borok the Silent's unspoken instructions: "follow instructions and there will be no problems."  </li>
<li>Fadda Brinebless, the goblin priest, performed blessing rituals, sprinkling loch water on the PCs and the boat.  </li>
<li>A Keelhauler eel lunged at the boat, splashing a PC, which Fadda cheerfully dismissed as a "hello" from the Deep Black.  </li>
<li>The party experienced an "Atmospheric Encounter": they passed through a field of <strong>Hydrothermal Vents</strong>, causing a one-hour detour due to the heated water.  </li>
<li>Another "Atmospheric Encounter" occurred: a <strong>Ghost Barge</strong> glided silently past, its spectral crew rowing endlessly. Fadda reacted with fear, performing a salt ritual, while Borok grimly acknowledged it as a common, albeit unsettling, sight on the loch. Grumble (if present) offered cynical commentary.  </li>
<li>The party encountered the <strong>"Whisperer's Omen"</strong>, a mandatory mid-voyage event where the water grew still and a sub-aural thrum vibrated through the ship. Fadda frantically requested help with a ritual to appease the "Whisperer."  <ul>
<li>The party engaged in a <strong>Group Skill Challenge</strong> (3 successes before 2 failures).  </li>
<li>Clank (Scott) successfully channeled arcane energy into the lichen, creating a "jangle and a hum bass line."  </li>
<li>Zyntra (Jeremiah) used rope to steady herself and the others, preventing components from being lost.  </li>
<li>The ritual was successful, calming the waters and driving the unseen creature away. Borok gave a rare nod of approval, stating, "Good."  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Approaching Cinderfork Foundry &amp; Initial Scouting:</strong>  </li>
<li>The party decided on an <strong>underwater infiltration</strong> via the Moonpool, with the siege drill being used to breach a wall on the west side of the foundry.  </li>
<li>They planned to coordinate with Grumble via <strong>sending stones</strong> and Haribo's <strong>Sporeling</strong> (which would be left with Grumble to signal when the drill was within 250 feet).  </li>
<li>Haribo (Bert) volunteered to scout the foundry, casting <em>Pass Without Trace</em> on himself and then Wild Shaping into an <strong>invisible bat</strong> (using an Invisibility Potion).  </li>
<li><strong>Haribo's Scouting Discoveries (as a bat):</strong>  <ul>
<li><strong>Docks:</strong> Spotted three ships: a "Slag-Mule" (Duergar barge), the "Silk-Reaver" (Drow yacht), and Valandor's familiar "Night-Talon" speedboat (recognizing it with "dread"). Noted two watchtowers flanking the entrance.  </li>
<li><strong>Ground Floor (Main Hall/Foyer):</strong> Flew through a portcullis into a large atrium with a 15-foot ceiling. Saw six off-duty Duergar workers playing cards and drinking. Noted a heavy, sealed, handle-less <strong>adamantine door</strong> on the west side (which they correctly assumed was the prison). Also saw a normal door (unlocked), a lift, and a stairwell.  </li>
<li><strong>Upper Level (Forge Area):</strong> Flew up the lift shaft (5-6 stories). Observed Master Smiths and Duergar workers "hammering on this shell" of metal around another Duergar, seemingly forcing him into a "big suit" (a Screamer). Noted rivers of molten magma and a "bubbling of magma" to the north. Saw a "Scrutinizer" (Peepers) construct patrolling.  </li>
<li><strong>Basement/Geothermal Plant:</strong> Flew down the stairwell. Entered a loud chamber filled with massive turning machinery and a spinning <strong>turbine</strong>. Noted a large room to the south with heavy fortified doors and heat-proof windows, filled with roiling, superheated steam, and a violently moving "massive form" (the Bound Geothermal Elemental). Determined the turbine blocked further passage, and its controls were in adjacent rooms.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Overheard Conversations (via bat scouting):</strong>  <ul>
<li><strong>Barracks/Mess Hall:</strong> Overheard two Duergar guards complaining about "Kaldar pushing everyone to the brink since that new black metal came in." They mentioned "the drow prisoner, the artificer," who was "supposed to make the forgings easier," but instead "the Screamers wail louder than ever." They also said, "They say they finally broke the prisoner today."  </li>
<li><strong>Workshop:</strong> Overheard two Duergar complaining about the "Peepers" constructs, confirming they were expensive and could "see right through a drow's disappearing trick."  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Infiltration of the Research Cottage (Sub-Level):</strong>  </li>
<li>The party (now back in regular form) entered the Moonpool and approached a "cozy-looking cottage" (Area 2).  </li>
<li>They decided to sneak in together, with Zyntra's <em>Pass Without Trace</em> providing advantage.  </li>
<li>Haribo sent his familiar spider (Skitter) to scout inside the cottage. Skitter reported seeing a "relatively cozy" interior and a woman cooking.  </li>
<li>Bentham, still disguised in his normal form, opened the unlocked porch door.  </li>
<li><strong>Encounter with Alyxina Fire-Beard:</strong>  <ul>
<li>Alyxina, Chief Researcher Korvun's wife, was cooking.  </li>
<li>Bentham (Brandon) ambushed her, grappling her and putting a hand over her mouth.  </li>
<li>Malagar (Austin) attempted to intimidate her, but missed.  </li>
<li>Bentham then interrogated her, asking about Valandor and the foundry's fortifications. Alyxina claimed she was "not in charge" and her husband was "just a researcher." Haribo's Insight check confirmed she was likely telling the truth about her limited knowledge.  </li>
<li>Malagar, in a brutal improvisation, slit Alyxina's throat, killing her. Bentham then dragged her body into the storage room.  </li>
<li>Haribo (Bert), using <em>Speak with Animals</em>, communicated with Alyxina's pet spider, Skitter, learning it liked "treats" (rats). Malagar successfully handled Skitter, feeding it a rat, and convinced it to follow him upstairs.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Looting the Storage Room (Area 3):</strong> The party found mundane supplies, but also several unlocked chests containing duergar work clothes, linens, and tools. Clank immediately began taking "spare parts."  </li>
<li><strong>Looting the Display Shelf (Area C1 - Loft Landing):</strong> Zyntra (Teri) successfully identified various valuable mineral specimens, including Adamantine, Mithral, Orichalcum, and Starmetal. The party decided to take them all.  </li>
<li><strong>Infiltration of Korvun's Loft/Study (Area C2/C3):</strong>  </li>
<li>Bentham (Brandon) shape-shifted into Alyxina's form, and the party proceeded upstairs.  </li>
<li>They encountered <strong>Chief Researcher Korvun</strong> (Alyxina's husband) in his study. Bentham, disguised as Alyxina, introduced the party as "college friends" and "research project" visitors. Rav'ithar introduced himself as a "famous author." Korvun was skeptical but allowed them to stay.  </li>
<li>The party immediately ambushed Korvun.  </li>
<li><strong>Combat with Korvun:</strong>  <ul>
<li>Rav'ithar  cast <em>Hold Person</em>, paralyzing Korvun.  </li>
<li>Haribo  used a "bacterial barrage" (Spores) to poison Korvun.  </li>
<li>Malagar (Austin) attempted a non-lethal attack with his rapier, but missed.  </li>
<li>Bentham (Brandon) then stabbed Korvun in the back, dealing significant damage.  </li>
<li>Zyntra attempted to disarm a trap on a locked chest (in Area C3 - Bedroom) but failed, triggering a loud alarm and being knocked unconscious by soporific gas.  </li>
<li>Clank (Scott), still downstairs, heard the alarm and switched his armor to "defender" mode.  </li>
<li>Korvun, no longer held, was still poisoned.  </li>
<li>Bentham interrogated the wounded Korvun, who revealed Valandor was "Upstairs, behind the high security adamantine door," and that three "special rods of unlocking" held by Master Smith Durkal, Acolyte Ghoran, and Director Koldar were needed to open it.  </li>
<li>Zyntra, now conscious, successfully disarmed the alarm and the gas trap.  </li>
<li>Bentham (Brandon) then murdered Korvun, stating, "I enjoyed killing your wife," as he shot him in the head.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discoveries and Session End:</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>Loot from Korvun's Study/Chest:</strong>  <ul>
<li>Three <strong>DÃ»mril Ingots</strong> (Black Mithril) stamped with King Aron II's rune, confirming they were smuggled from the "royal catacombs of Auldbaern."  </li>
<li>A <strong>Prototype Resonance Lens</strong> (magical item) that can cast <em>detect thoughts</em> and grants advantage on checks to interact with psionic devices.  </li>
<li>A letter from <strong>Director Koldar</strong> (the foundry boss) to Korvun, sealed with House Glutthraz wax, demanding "quicken Screamer output or funding is cut," confirming Glutthraz's involvement.  </li>
<li>A "Transmutation for the Tireless Smith" manual (taken by Clank).  </li>
<li>DÃ»mril Fragments (two found, worth 30 gp each).  </li>
<li>Korvun's Coded Folio (diagrams, graphs, charts, mentioning "Auldbaern cache" and "House Glutthraz will pay dearly for secrecy").  </li>
<li>A "Folded Route-Map &amp; Note" from "Tharn Deep-Spire" hinting at the "Royal Catacombs" and "DÃ»mril cache."  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Valandor's Status Clarification (from Korvun):</strong> The party now knows Valandor is imprisoned upstairs behind an adamantine door, requiring specific rods to open. <em>(This contradicts the pre-planned "fixed point" in the campaign guide where Valandor is found dead, implying a change in the narrative for the players.)</em>  </li>
<li><strong>XP Awarded:</strong> 300 XP each for defeating Korvun (CR 5). Additional XP awarded for exploration (100 XP to Haribo), disarming the outer door (25 XP to Zyntra), and helping with the sea ritual (50 XP to Haribo, Malagar, Zyntra). Haribo leveled up to Level 4.  </li>
<li>The session concluded with the party having secured valuable intelligence and Black Mithril, but with a clear path to Valandor's prison and the need to acquire the Rods of Opening from the remaining bosses.</li>
