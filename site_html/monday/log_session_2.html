<h1 id="session-2">Session 2</h1>
<p>The session began with a recap of the previous game, reminding the players of House T'alzar's precarious situation due to the economic warfare waged by House Glutthras. The party revisited their victory against the Drider in the fighting pits, an event orchestrated by the zealous Vyssinia, and confirmed that the Amulet of Misty Step was the reward for the killing blow.</p>
<p>The main part of the session covered the mission briefing from Matron Mother Severine, the party's subsequent preparations, and their journey through the city to the docks.</p>
<h4 id="the-mission-briefing-&amp;-miraleth's-interruption"><strong>The Mission Briefing &amp; Miraleth's Interruption</strong></h4>
<p>Matron Severine briefed the party on the official mission: her son and the party's brother, Valandor, was three days overdue from his research mission at Cinderfork Foundry. The party's objectives are to infiltrate the foundry, find Valandor, recover his research on "Black Mithril," and, if necessary, retaliate against House Glutthras . The Matron outlined three potential infiltration plans:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Force:</strong> Using a massive siege drill operated by the flesh golem, Grumble .  </li>
<li><strong>Stealth:</strong> An underwater approach using Potions of Water Breathing and Scrolls of Invisibility .  </li>
<li><strong>Deception:</strong> Using disguises to pose as neutral traders .</li>
</ul>
<p>The briefing was interrupted by Miraleth, Valandor's 12-year-old daughter. She rushed in, distressed, holding a broken clockwork spider her father had made. She told the party about a recurring nightmare of "fire and hammers" where she heard her father calling for help, expressing her fear that he was in real trouble.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Player Interaction:</strong> Malagar reassured Miraleth that they would bring her father home safely . Haribo used a Wild Magic surge to summon a fey spider to comfort her, which she appreciated .  </li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong> This encounter served to personalize the mission's stakes, centering the emotional weight on Valandor's and his daughter's fates before the party departed.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="valandor's-workshop-&amp;-the-telepathic-shark"><strong>Valandor's Workshop &amp; The Telepathic Shark</strong></h4>
<p>Led by the spymaster Lirael, the party traveled to Valandor's secure workshop in the city's industrial district to retrieve the siege drill .</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Guardian:</strong> They were met by a guardian construct, an adamantine pillbug nicknamed "Nugget".  </li>
<li><strong>Teeth in Dark:</strong> Inside, they discovered a large tank containing a telepathic Underdark shark named "Teeth in Dark," which Valandor was using for experiments related to Black Mithril. Malagar used his ability to speak with animals to communicate with the agitated shark, learning it was hungry and lonely. He went to the market, purchased a large quantity of fish, and fed the shark, calming it and seemingly earning its trust .  </li>
<li><strong>Research &amp; Clues:</strong> The party investigated Valandor's "Oculo-Metalloscope" and his research notes. They discovered his analysis of "Black Mithril," noting that it was identical to a shard found in the "Catacombs of Aldebaran," the ruins upon which their city of Vlyn'darastyl was built .</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-procession-&amp;-journey-to-the-docks"><strong>The Procession &amp; Journey to the Docks</strong></h4>
<p>To transport the large siege drill through the city without attracting attention, Lirael cast the spell</p>
<p><em>Seeming</em> .</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Disguise:</strong> The drill was disguised as an obsidian statue of Lolth, and the party was disguised as temple attendants in a solemn religious procession, complete with illusory cattle (Rothe) and a hymn played by Lirael to deter onlookers .  </li>
<li><strong>Street Encounters:</strong> During their journey, they successfully intimidated a drunken noble who tried to interfere. They were then extorted by a street gang, the "Rust Rats," and chose to pay the 100 gold piece toll to avoid combat and maintain their cover .</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="arrival-at-the-docks"><strong>Arrival at the Docks</strong></h4>
<p>The party successfully reached the rendezvous point at the less-used Night-Tide Docks.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Ferrymen:</strong> Lirael dropped the illusion and provided the passphrase—<em>"The silver moon still sings in the dark"</em>—to the waiting ferrymen. The crew consisted of the hulking Orog captain,<br />
<strong>Borok the Silent</strong>, and his goblin first mate, <strong>Fadda Brinebless</strong>.  </li>
<li><strong>The Vessel:</strong> Their transport is a skiff pulled by two giant, carnivorous eels known as Keelhaulers .</li>
</ul>
<p>Lirael bid the party farewell, and the session concluded as they boarded the skiff to begin the 20-hour journey across the Black Loch to Cinderfork Foundry.</p>
