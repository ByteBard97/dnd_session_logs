<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Arrival at the Dead Falls:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The party navigated a flooded passageway to reach a hidden lake where the ghost ship, the <em>Ultros</em>, was moored.</li>
<li>While scouting, Kain killed a waterlogged undead corpse floating in the passage.</li>
<li>Rhy-At explored the lakebed, discovering the remains of a previous adventurer and recovering a weather-damaged journal, 50 gp, and a silver locket.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Boarding the <em>Ultros</em></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon boarding the ship, Kain touched the main mast and experienced a vision of the dryad Delphia, whose spirit is bound to the wood.</li>
<li>This act awakened the ship, causing its spectral crew and its captain, Estor Arkelander, to materialize.</li>
<li>A large, ghostly gray horned owl appeared in the rigging and was befriended by Zephyrion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encounter with Estor Arkelander:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Estor revealed his immortality is the result of a pact with "The Lady of Dreams" (Lutheria).</li>
<li>He offered the party a quest: hunt down and destroy his three "traitorous" thanes. He promised that the most capable hero would inherit the ship and become its new captain.</li>
<li>The party's insight revealed this offer is a trap, and Estor likely intends to possess the "winner".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Combat with Skaethon, the First Mate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The party located the first thane, Skaethon, in the captain's cabin. He confirmed Estor's offer was a trap for possession.</li>
<li>Kain attacked Skaethon, initiating combat.</li>
<li>Nikandros used the <strong>Scepter of King Driptongue</strong> to cast <em>Dark Resonance</em>, imbuing the party with a vampiric bite attack they could use as a reaction when taking damage.</li>
<li>During the fight, Zephyrion bit the animated sword <em>Ebony</em> in half, and Tharok bit a specter to death.</li>
<li>Skaethon and his animated armor proved to be powerful foes, knocking both Zephyrion and Tharok unconscious.</li>
<li>Andrew Lynx dealt the killing blow with a series of critical <em>Eldritch Blasts</em>, destroying Skaethon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Loot and Aftermath:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Upon Skaethon's defeat, his animated gear became inert. The party recovered his magical armor, <strong>Azurescale</strong>, and his damaged sword, <strong>Ebony</strong>.</li>
<li>A chest in the cabin contained 300 gp, 50 pp, a black pearl, four bloodstones, and other valuables.</li>
<li>Three unique potions were found: <strong>Felix Felicis (Liquid Luck)</strong>, a <strong>Potion of Etherealness</strong>, and <strong>Sandman's Embrace</strong> (a sleep potion).</li>
<li>Tharok's maximum HP is temporarily reduced from the specters' life drain attacks.</li>
<li>Estor Arkelander remains on the upper deck, reading a book titled <strong>"The Ledger of Wills,"</strong> awaiting the party's next move.</li>
</ul>
