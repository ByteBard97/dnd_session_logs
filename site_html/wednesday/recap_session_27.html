<p>Previously, on OODL D\&amp;D!</p>
<p>Our heroes, fresh from their triumph in the reptilian cultist warrens and having narrowly escaped the Maw of the Pit, plunged into the murky depths of Mytros's malfunctioning sewers. After confronting a foul Otyugh and clearing the larval growths, they emerged victorious, having saved the city's waterworks and rescued innocents .</p>
<p>But the true test of their heroism began when Queen Vallus herself summoned them! Trellus and Septia, the insidious Lutherian cultists who smuggled children, were brought before the Queen in chains, their vile deeds exposed by your unwavering efforts. With justice served, Queen Vallus revealed her true purpose: a vital quest to the Mithral Forge beneath the Great Falls of Arkelon, to commission an item crucial to Thylea's fate.</p>
<p>As a testament to their valor, the Queen offered a selection of powerful artifacts. Through eloquent persuasion (and perhaps a bit of well-placed flattery!), the party convinced her to grant them two of these legendary items: the versatile Wand of Switch Step and the incredibly potent Robe of the Weave. Yet, with the rewards came a hushed, critical warning: DO NOT deliver King Acastus's coveted <em>Ultros</em> to him, as his obsession with glory risks the ship falling into the wrong hands.</p>
<p>After indulging in a well-deserved Hero's Feast at the palace, curing Tharok's sewer plague and bolstering their very life force , the heroes ventured into the seedy Satyrs' Tail bar. Nikandros wowed the crowd with a mesmerizing performance, conjuring squirrels to re-enact their recent sewer battle, earning a tidy sum . Meanwhile, Kain's contacts proved invaluable, as Sari the Knight divulged crucial rumors about Queen Thessalia, a hidden underwater tunnel leading to Themis, and even a monstrous, mutated Hydra guarding the Amazons' lair .</p>
<p>The next morning, after a productive shopping spree for vital potions and gear, the party booked passage on</p>
<p>The Swift Dawn, a speedy riverboat captained by the no-nonsense Captain Stormwind . Nikandros's bardic prowess once again shone, conjuring a perfect tailwind with his harp and reducing their travel time to a mere four hours.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at the Mithral Forge, a place bustling with activity and the clang of hammers, the party used a clever</p>
<p>Mage Hand to open the secret waterfall entrance. Inside, they were greeted by Pyra and Vulcan, the divine smiths themselves! Pyra presented their first commission: the</p>
<p>Cloak of Magic Immunity, an extraordinary garment capable of rendering its wearer immune to hostile spells .</p>
<p>But the surprises didn't end there! Vulcan unveiled a damaged yet magnificent construct, a</p>
<p>Calydonian messenger from ancient times . For a thousand gold pieces and two Mithril ingots (generously provided by the party from their own stash!), this majestic flying courier will soon be repaired, capable of delivering items and materials directly to them, wherever their adventures may lead . And to top it all off, Tharok received an unexpected and adorable new companion:</p>
<p>Baby Bjorn, a baby basilisk, now his responsibility to nurture and feed !</p>
<p>The journey continues, with powerful artifacts in hand, a loyal new companion, and a flying messenger on the way, the heroes are more ready than ever to face the trials ahead!</p>
