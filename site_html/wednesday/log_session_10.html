<p><strong>Epic Path Reminders</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ariasia ("Ari"), The Lost One:</strong><br />
  You've learned that the key to finding your way home lies in the <strong>lost treasure of the Dragonlords</strong>. Pythor hinted that the undead captain Estor Arkelander—haunting the legendary ship Ultros—last possessed this treasure. To move forward, you must eventually seek out the Ultros and confront Estor's ghost. For now, the city's troubles and the stolen Horn of Balmytria stand in the way, but keep an ear open for anything that might lead you to that ghostly vessel.  </li>
<li><strong>Demetrius, The Vanished One:</strong><br />
  You recovered the Crown of the Dragonlords, but <strong>Gaius of the Order of Sydon</strong> has stolen your famed armor. He's reportedly fortified himself on an island in the Cerulean Sea, well-guarded and loyal to the Titan Sydon. To fully reclaim your legacy, you'll need to retrieve your armor from Gaius. But first, you must survive your current obligations in Estoria, including the grim deal made with Gaius over Princess Anora's sacrifice.  </li>
<li><strong>Kain, The Dragonslayer:</strong><br />
  Destiny calls you to become the bane of evil dragons. To forge a weapon worthy of such a task, you must speak with the <strong>Forgekeeper in the Mithral Mines</strong>. Keep watch for clues that lead to the hidden Mithral Forge.  </li>
<li><strong>Kalian, The Gifted One:</strong><br />
  Your grandmother's spirit and the Oracle Versi guide you towards resurrecting the glory of the Dragonlords and exacting vengeance on Sydon.   </li>
<li><strong>Tharok, The Cursed One:</strong><br />
  Damon, the guardian of the Necropolis, directed you to <strong>Scorpion Island</strong> to seek the Lotus Witch, who may hold the key to ending your curse. While that journey lies ahead, the path is dangerous and your party's immediate predicament in Estoria demands attention first. Remember that the answers you seek are out there, beyond the city's walls, once your current duties are done.  </li>
<li><strong>Zephyrion, The Demi-god:</strong><br />
  You've met your father, Pythor, who revealed that the green dragon Hexia stole your mother away. Before you can undertake that rescue and claim your divine legacy, you must help resolve the crisis in Estoria. You've agreed to take Princess Anora's place in the sacrifice at the Rock of Estor. Surviving that deadly bargain will reaffirm your worthiness and strengthen the bond with your father.</li>

<p>Log</p>
<ul>
<li>We sent out our sneaky ranger who can turn invisible in darkness and he scouted ahead  </li>
<li>He noticed stench filled rooms full of loathsome troglodytes  </li>
<li>We decided to go north into the north (dwarvish) side of the mine complex  </li>
<li>There is a huge dead dog with several smaller two headed dogs munching on its corps  </li>
<li>We slay all of them in a huge battle  </li>
<li>We explore all the rooms around here and discover a dwarven bronze room with an inscription next to its entrance  </li>
<li>We spend some time looting the various rooms that are in decay  </li>
<li>Kain sneaks down the corridor and can hear what sounds like the squawking of chickens  </li>
<li>The party catches up and decides to take down the vicious chicken monsters  </li>
<li>We realize these are the dreaded "cockatrices" and notice that there are multiple people in the area who have been turned to stone by their pecking  </li>
<li>Finally we slay all of them and recover their beaks and gullets to be turned into "flesh to stone" arrows by a skilled artisan back in town  </li>
<li>We loot all the dwarven rooms in this area and we recover a dwarven seal with a dragon on it. Ari finds an ornately decorated dwarven mug that appears to be magical  </li>
<li>We decide to go back south and deal with the troglodytes  </li>
<li>A huge fight ensues and we fight many troglodyte brutes and their stench is overpowering   </li>
<li>Finally the party emerges victorious with many corpses littering the floor of the cave  </li>
<li>We provided healing aid to the centaur captive who has been brutally tortured after his flesh was roasted over a fire. These are the two centaurs we are seeking who were captured by the troglodytes.</li>
