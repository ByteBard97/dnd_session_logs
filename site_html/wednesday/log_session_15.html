<ul>
<li>We decided to follow Kyrah's proposal to clear the storm  </li>
<li>Kain talked to Icarus the dragon and felt something is not right with the King's story  </li>
<li>Before walking out the palace, we were accosted and summoned with an audience with Queen Vallus by Makhaira, which told us she will prepare a feast for us while we wait for our audience  </li>
<li>We persuade the queen to tell us the truth about what's all happening here, and she reveals that the king is driven to dispose of us once we give him what he wants, and on top she made us take on an OATH of secrecy before revealing to us that the king received Icarus as an egg 25 years ago by Lutheria herself, and has been giving Icarus potion of aging to accelerate his maturity.<br />
<strong>Departing the City &amp; Facing the Storm:</strong>  </li>
<li>After leaving court, the party stepped out into the fury of Sydon's storm. The tempest not only raged over the city but carried the echoes of divine retribution.  </li>
<li><strong>Random Encounter – HARRIED BY THE STORM:</strong>  </li>
<li>The heroes struggled against howling winds and pelting rain, testing their resolve and unity against the chaotic elements.  </li>
<li><strong>Random Encounter – OVERTURNED CART ON THE BRIDGE:</strong>  </li>
<li>On a rain-slicked bridge, they encountered an overturned cart. Tharok's mighty axe—revealed to be a magical lightning rod—played a pivotal role as he pulled the cart to safety.  </li>
<li>Kain's ranger magic spurred the growth of entangling plants, subduing the panicked horses, while Zephyrion heroically rescued Thalia, earning her lasting gratitude and a promise of healing potions plus a 25% discount at her shop.  </li>
<li><strong>Random Encounter – LIGHTNING'S WRATH:</strong>  </li>
<li>As Sydon's lightning threatened to wreak havoc, Tharok's axe absorbed the bolt's power. This not only protected the party but also halted the animation of nearby statues, a sign of the storm's magical malice.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Journey into the Vineyard &amp; Fae Intrigue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The party's path eventually led them out of the city and into a sprawling vineyard. Here, the storm's fury waned, and the veil between the mortal realm and the Fey grew thin.  </li>
<li>They discovered the Sylvan Compass—a mystical artifact etched with ancient runes—that guides travelers along hidden, enchanted pathways within the vineyard. This detail underscores the region's deep ties to fey magic and old traditions.  </li>
<li>In the vineyard, Evalina, a courteous satyr, welcomed them. Mistaking the party for wine buyers, she offered enchanted wine samples that each carried unique magical properties. She also directed them up the river and warned them to watch for her lost children, further hinting at the vineyard's secretive, otherworldly nature.<br />
<strong>The Glade &amp; the Confrontation with Boreas:</strong>  </li>
<li>Following Evalina's advice, the heroes ventured deeper into the vineyard along the river until they reached a magical glade—an oasis of calm amid the tempest.  </li>
<li>Here, they found Boreas immersed in playing his magical harp for a group of water nymphs. The nymphs vanished into the water at the sight of the heroes, adding an air of mystery.  </li>
<li>Initially, Kyrah hid in the bushes, watching as the conversation unfolded. When the party began probing into the true nature of their quest, Boreas erupted in anger.  </li>
<li>He accused the party of falling for Kyrah's enticing promises and tall tales, revealing his deep-seated resentment over their shared past.  </li>
<li>His outburst made it clear that Kyrah's version of events was incomplete—and that her hidden history with Boreas was more complex and painful than the party had been led to believe.</li>
