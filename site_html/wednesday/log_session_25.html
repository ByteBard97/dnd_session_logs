<h1 id="session-25">Session 25</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> Sunday, 2nd week, late afternoon to evening.  </li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Mytros Sewers – Engine-Works Vault (UL-6a/b), Great Cistern Complex (UR10), Upper-Right Cave Warrens (UR9, UR2, UR3, UR5, UR6, UR7, UR1).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Return to the Engineers &amp; The Next Task</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The party returned the <strong>Aetheric Capacitor</strong> to Chief Engineer Petros "Ironhand" Galanis in the Engine-Works Vault.  </li>
<li>They proceeded east towards the Grand Cistern Complex to find the second component, the Vulcan-Forged Pressure Valve.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Grand Cistern &amp; a New Lead</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Upon arriving at the Great Cistern (UR10), the party found it dangerously flooded and encountered Foreman Kastros and Engineer Thalia in a state of panic.  </li>
<li>They learned that the <strong>Chief Engineer</strong> was missing, last seen investigating structural anomalies in a previously uncharted cave system connected to the sewers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Infiltration of the Cave Warrens</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kain</strong> scouted ahead and discovered a secret passage behind a recently rebuilt wall (UR9), which led into the cave warrens.  </li>
<li><strong>Major Victory:</strong> Kain expertly disarmed a complex trap involving a pressure plate, collapsing ceiling, and a flood of acid bile, allowing the party safe entry into the hostile territory.  </li>
<li>The caves were revealed to be the lair of a savage cult of reptilian creatures (Drakonians/Kobolds) who worship a monstrous entity called the "Maw of the Pit."</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rescue of the Chief Engineer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kain's</strong> stealthy reconnaissance located a prison area (UR2) where several captives were being held for a sacrificial ritual.  </li>
<li><strong>Major Victory:</strong> Using the <em>Pass Without Trace</em> spell for concealment, the party executed a flawless surprise attack, silently eliminating the jailers before they could raise an alarm.  </li>
<li><strong>Liberated Captives:</strong> The party successfully rescued the captives, who were identified as:  </li>
<li><strong>Engineer Talia Ironrack</strong>, the missing Chief Engineer.  </li>
<li><strong>Old Finn</strong>, a grizzled city sewer worker.  </li>
<li><strong>Snik</strong>, a goblin captive from another tribe.  </li>
<li>The party escorted the rescued individuals back to the safety of the main sewer tunnels before vowing to clear the rest of the warren.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cleansing the Warrens</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The party systematically and ruthlessly cleared the outer chambers of the Drakonian cult, neutralizing threats in their communal nest (UR1), hatchery (UR3), fungal grove (UR5), and workshop (UR7).  </li>
<li>Their coordinated stealth tactics allowed them to ambush and eliminate numerous groups of kobolds, including warriors and scale sorcerers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Loot &amp; Discoveries</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The party recovered several items from the cleared rooms, including a beautifully crafted music box (worth 250 gp), a Carnelian gemstone (worth 50 gp), a kobold-brewed healing potion, and several large, well-cared-for kobold eggs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Session End State</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The party has successfully rescued the Chief Engineer and cleared the outlying sections of the Drakonian warrens.  </li>
<li>They are aware that the heart of the cult's power—and likely a major boss encounter—lies ahead in the main sanctum (UR4), where a shaman named Vrasq was reportedly leading rituals.  </li>
<li><strong>Next Objective:</strong> Confront the leader of the Drakonian cult and destroy the "Maw of the Pit" to fully secure the area and complete their mission in this part of the sewers.</li>
</ul>
