<h1 id="session-28">Session 28</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Final Preparations at the Mithral Forge:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The session began with the party at the Mithral Forge, discussing their newly acquired magic items. Nikandros attuned to the powerful <strong>Robe of the Weave</strong>, while the <strong>Cloak of Magic Immunity</strong> was placed in the party loot for later consideration.</li>
<li>Kain questioned Volkan about a weapon powerful enough to slay his ultimate quarry. Volkan spoke of legendary "god-killer" weapons forged by the Gygans during the First War.</li>
<li><strong>New Lead:</strong> Volkan directed Kain to the <strong>Isle of Yonder</strong>, a fortress controlled by Sydon's fanatics. He mentioned a scholar there named <strong>Chondrus</strong>, a servant of the Lady of Dreams, who collects these rare Gygan artifacts. He warned that Chondrus is treacherous and the island is extremely dangerous.</li>
<li>With a successful history check, Nikandros recalled seeing Chondrus in King Acastus's court.</li>
<li>Volkan promised he could improve any Gygan weapon Kain might recover and assured the party that Queen Vallus would provide a means to navigate the Cerulean Gulf once they had secured the <em>Ultros</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Journey to the Sour Vintage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The party departed the Mithral Forge via riverboat around 3 PM. The 10-hour journey brought them to the banks of the river near the Sour Vintage at 1 AM, the magical effects of their Hero's Feast having worn off.</li>
<li>They decided to brave the 3-hour trek through the woods in the dead of night.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Midnight Encounter with Goatlings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Due to a series of poor stealth rolls, the party stumbled directly into a clearing where a dozen goatlings were performing a ritual dance around an uprooted tree.</li>
<li>Rhy-At's attempt at a peaceful offering of cheap liquor was met with confusion and the eerie music of a shaman's pan pipes. Another shaman caused magical snakes to erupt from Rhy-At's boots, which he calmly ignored.</li>
<li>Rhy-At successfully intimidated the goatlings into backing down. Seizing the opportunity, Nikandros then persuaded the cowed creatures to offer the party a tribute.</li>
<li>The party received a <strong>Goodberry Tonic</strong> from the goatling shaman and was allowed to pass peacefully.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Return to the Sour Vintage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The heroes arrived at the tavern around 4:30 AM. The establishment had been visibly upgraded and rebranded to capitalize on its association with the "Heroes of the Prophecy."</li>
<li>They were greeted by an awestruck stable boy, Marcus, who awkwardly offered to prepare a stall for Zephyrion.</li>
<li>While waiting for the tavern to fully open, Zephyrion visited the town's farrier. By recounting the tale of his heroic deeds, he received a complimentary hoof trim and new horseshoes, which magically granted him increased speed and sure-footedness for 24 hours. Rhy-At, meanwhile, constructed a small, impromptu shrine to the five gods near the tavern.</li>
<li>At 8 AM, the party entered the tavern to a hero's welcome from the patrons and the innkeeper, Aetala. Zephyrion magnanimously bought a round of drinks for the entire establishment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gathering Rumors &amp; Warnings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kain spoke with <strong>Alexios the former smuggler</strong>, who gave a grim warning about the Dead Falls. He spoke of a partner who vanished there years ago after seeing a ship in a hidden inlet, and mentioned that the water levels change and passages flood without warning.</li>
<li>Following this, Kain engaged in some masterful haggling with Alexios, acquiring a magical <strong>Goblin Mask</strong> for the bargain price of 500 gold and four worthless gemstones.</li>
<li>Kain then spoke with <strong>Corax the hunter</strong>, who provided an even more chilling account. He described a deathly silence that falls over the area at the stroke of midnight, of rock formations that look like screaming faces, and his unnerving certainty that the canyon walls themselves <em>breathe</em> and shift. He strongly advised the party not to travel there at midnight and to flee if the canyon begins to narrow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tavern Happenings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While information was being gathered, the rest of the party made their mark on the tavern.</li>
<li>Zephyrion, in a grand display of confidence, had the merchant <strong>Philomena</strong> apply scented (and highly flammable) oils to his glistening equine physique.</li>
<li>Nikandros played cards with <strong>Margot</strong>, a grieving war widow, bringing a smile to her face and drawing the jealous eye of another patron, Dorian.</li>
<li>Kyra performed for the crowd, and Rhy-At took a moment to polish his warforged chassis with boiled olive oil.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Session End:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The session concluded with the party having gathered multiple, ominous warnings about the Dead Falls. They are well-rested, well-supplied, and now face the daunting task of approaching the haunted waters where the ghost ship <em>Ultros</em> is said to lie in wait.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course. Here is a detailed, bullet-pointed summary of Session 29 for your quest log.</p>
