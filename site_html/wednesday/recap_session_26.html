<p>Heroes of the Prophecy! Your work in the foul warrens of the reptilian cultists had reached its bloody crescendo. Before you, the shaman Vrask led his followers in a religious frenzy, their chilling chants echoing over a dark, abyssal pit. You moved as one, silent shadows in the gloom, and unleashed a surprise attack. Arrow and arcane power silenced the guards, and Zephyrion's trident thrust silenced the shaman, ending his foul ritual. But your victory was met not with silence, but with a sickening, guttural sound of crunching bones from the darkness below.</p>
<p>From the chasm's edge, a horror was birthedâ€”the Maw of the Pit, a terrifying mass of flesh and bone-like legs. And as you battled this aberration, a greater terror emerged: the Gullet Sovereign, a massive, veiny tendril with a giant mouth, rose from the abyss to challenge you.</p>
<p>The battle that followed was a desperate struggle for survival. The Sovereign's powerful strikes battered the party, grappling both Tharok and Rhy-at, and knocking the sorcerer unconscious with a brutal blow. But in a flash of lightning and rage, Tharok unleashed the power of his axe, blasting the tendril and freeing his companion from its grasp.</p>
<p>With the Maw of the Pit destroyed by Rhy-at's fiery magic, Tharok performed a legendary feat. He launched himself from a ledge, axe in hand, and plunged into the pit, delivering the final, decisive blow that sent the Gullet Sovereign collapsing into a lifeless heap.</p>
<p>In the gory aftermath, you descended into the pit to survey the carnage and claim your spoils. Amidst the slime and shattered bones, you discovered a trove of riches, including 1,600 gold pieces, precious gems, and an ornate hammer pulsing with the power to turn wealth into destructive force.</p>
<p>Your grim work done, you returned to the engineers. With the parts you recovered and the monsters you slew, you averted disaster in the Great Cistern. Foreman Castro, overjoyed, promised a handsome reward from the Queen awaits you on the surface.</p>
<p>Now, having taken a moment to recover and feeling a surge of new power as you reach your 7th level, you stand ready. The sewers are safer, but your journey is far from over. What will you do next?</p>
