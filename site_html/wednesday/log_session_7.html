<li><strong>Xander's Revelation</strong>  </li>
<li>In the hallowed halls of the Necropolis, the mighty Dragonlord <strong>Xander Huorath</strong> imparts a dire message to <strong>Demetrius</strong>:  <ul>
<li><strong>Sydon's Chief Military Leader, Gaius</strong>, has <strong>stolen Demetrius' legendary armor</strong>.  </li>
<li>Gaius, a formidable warrior and one of <strong>Sydon's most ruthless servants</strong>, has hidden the armor on his <strong>fortified island</strong> in the <strong>Cerulean Sea</strong>.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>A New Ally Arrives</strong>  </li>
<li>As the party prepares to leave the tomb of Xander, a new figure emerges from the shadows:  <ul>
<li><strong>Kalian, "The Gifted One"</strong>, sent by the enigmatic <strong>Oracle Versi</strong> to replace their fallen wizard companion.  </li>
<li>The party entrusts <strong>Kalian</strong> with the <strong>crown of the Dragonlords</strong>, a pivotal artifact tied to his destiny. <strong>Ari</strong> watches in bewildered astonishment, wondering about this unexpected exchange.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Equipping the Heroes</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>Demetrius</strong> dons the <strong>Breastplate of Mytros</strong>, feeling its ancient power resonate with his noble heritage.  </li>
<li><strong>Confronting the Black Pudding</strong>  </li>
<li>Venturing into <strong>Cosmo's Tomb</strong>, the party faces a formidable <strong>black pudding</strong>:  <ul>
<li>After a fierce battle, they triumph over the amorphous threat, securing an <strong>adamantium breastplate and shield</strong>.  </li>
<li>However, the black pudding's corrosive <strong>acid</strong> wreaks havoc, <strong>damaging Zephyrion's mail armor</strong> and other gear.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Exploring the Necropolis</strong>  </li>
<li>In <strong>Tomb #5</strong>, the party finds no body, heightening the mystery surrounding these sacred grounds.  </li>
<li><strong>Tomb #6</strong> reveals a treasure trove:  <ul>
<li>By carefully <strong>pulling off the lid</strong>, they uncover a <strong>mythril breastplate, a kopis, and a mythril shield</strong>.  </li>
<li><strong>Kalian</strong> inadvertently triggers the <strong>curse of the graverobber</strong> without touching the items, adding a layer of peril to their haul.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Journey Back to Estoria</strong>  </li>
<li>Deciding to leave the Necropolis, the party makes their way back to <strong>Estoria</strong>:  <ul>
<li>They take a necessary <strong>long rest</strong> on the road, with <strong>Ari</strong> feeling a surge of joy as she gains the ability to <strong>fly</strong> until her next roll.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Visiting Volkan's Hall</strong>  </li>
<li>Back in the city, the heroes head to <strong>Volkan's Hall</strong>:  <ul>
<li><strong>Zephyrion</strong> presents his <strong>damaged armor</strong> to <strong>Volkan</strong>, who agrees to repair it in <strong>two days</strong> for <strong>10 gp</strong>.  </li>
<li><strong>Volkan</strong> reveals that to <strong>repair their items</strong>, they need <strong>Pythor's Hammer</strong> and the <strong>Mythril Forge</strong>.  </li>
<li>To <strong>lift the curses</strong> from their treasures and <strong>Kalian</strong>, the party plans to visit the <strong>Dragon Shrine</strong>.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Selling Their Loot</strong>  </li>
<li>The party decides to <strong>sell some of their inventory to Volkan</strong> to prepare for the challenges ahead.  </li>
<li><strong>Meeting King Pythor</strong>  </li>
<li>An <strong>attendant</strong> approaches the party, inviting them to meet <strong>King Pythor</strong> himself. They receive a mysterious <strong>scroll</strong> before heading to the palace.  </li>
<li>Inside the grand yet gloomy <strong>Estorian Palace</strong>, the party finds <strong>King Pythor</strong> in a state of drunken despair:  <ul>
<li><strong>Aunty Kyrah</strong>, <strong>Goddess of Music</strong> and sister to Pythor, scolds him for his <strong>self-pitying excesses</strong>.  </li>
<li><strong>Zephyrion</strong> steps forward, engaging in a heartfelt conversation with <strong>Pythor</strong>:  </li>
<li>A poignant <strong>father-son moment</strong> unfolds as <strong>Pythor</strong> shares the tragic tale of <strong>Zephyrion's mother</strong>, who was <strong>stolen by the fearsome dragon Hexia</strong> and taken to a distant <strong>island</strong>.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Confronting Gaius</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>Gaius</strong>, the arrogant leader of the <strong>Order of Sydon</strong>, confronts the party within the palace:  <ul>
<li>He demands the <strong>sacrifice of Princess Anora</strong> to <strong>Sydon</strong>, seeking to <strong>humiliate King Pythor</strong>.  </li>
<li>Through <strong>diplomacy and clever negotiation</strong>, the party persuades <strong>Gaius</strong> to allow them to <strong>take Anora's place</strong> as the sacrifice at the <strong>Rock of Estor</strong> during the next full moon, agreeing to be <strong>chained and disarmed</strong>.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ari's Destiny Unveiled</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>Ariasia</strong> inquires about her <strong>Epic Path</strong>, and <strong>Pythor</strong> reveals:  <ul>
<li>The ghost of the venerable <strong>Dragonlord Estor Arkelander</strong> holds the key to the <strong>lost treasure of the Dragonlords</strong> aboard his legendary ship, the <strong>Ultros</strong>.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Journey to the Dragon Shrine</strong>  </li>
<li>The party sets out for the <strong>Dragon Shrine</strong>, seeking to <strong>remove the curses</strong> and <strong>restore their enchanted items</strong>.  </li>
<li>Upon arrival, they meet <strong>Aesop</strong>, the wise <strong>keeper of the Shrine</strong>:  <ul>
<li><strong>Aesop</strong> mourns the <strong>theft of the Horn of Balmytria</strong>, a sacred artifact vital to their quest.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lifting the Curses</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>Kalian</strong> and <strong>Demetrius</strong> persuade <strong>Aesop</strong> to perform a <strong>ritual to remove the curse</strong>:  <ul>
<li>The <strong>curse of the graverobber</strong> is lifted from <strong>Kalian</strong>, but he is now bound by an <strong>oath</strong> to <strong>return the Horn of Balmytria</strong>.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Clues in the Wilderness</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>Kain</strong> discovers <strong>small hoof prints</strong> stained with <strong>magical wine</strong>, identifying the mischief-makers as <strong>goatlings</strong>â€”<strong>mischievous and sometimes evil fey</strong> resembling small satyrs.  </li>
<li>The trail leads <strong>south of Estoria</strong> into the <strong>forests</strong>, pointing towards the <strong>Mossy Temple</strong>, the ominous abode of <strong>Demetria</strong>, the <strong>fey Sister of Versi</strong>.  </li>
<li><strong>Preparing for the Full Moon Sacrifice</strong>  </li>
<li>With five days remaining until the full moon, the party must balance their time between <strong>securing their equipment</strong>, <strong>unraveling curses</strong>, and <strong>pursuing clues</strong> to thwart the impending sacrifice.</li>
</ul>
