<p><strong>07/02/2025</strong></p>
<p>Your last session began in the thrumming heat of the Mithral Forge. Armed with newly forged treasures and the promise of the <em>Calydonian Messenger</em> soon to take flight, you received a crucial piece of the puzzle for your resident Dragonslayer. Volkan, the grizzled smith, pulled Kain aside, speaking of weapons forged by Gygans—god-killers—and of a horned scholar named Chondrus who hoards them on the fortified Isle of Yonder. A new, dangerous path revealed itself.</p>
<p>With goodbyes said and Tharok taking up the solemn duty of guarding the newly adopted baby basilisk, Bjorn, you began the journey east. A swift river passage gave way to a tense, moonlit trek through the woods. Your approach was anything but subtle, leading you directly into a clearing where a bizarre ritual was underway: a dozen goatlings dancing wildly around an uprooted tree. A tense standoff ensued, with Rhy-At's offering of cheap liquor met with confusion and pan pipes. After shrugging off a boot-full of snakes, Rhy-At's commanding presence, followed by Nikandros's silver-tongued persuasion, not only cowed the creatures but saw you leaving with a <em>Goodberry Tonic</em> for your troubles—a tribute from the intimidated beast-men.</p>
<p>You arrived at the Sour Vintage at the ungodly hour of 4:30 AM to a sight both familiar and changed. The tavern, now a monument to your previous heroism, was grander than you remembered. The star-struck stable boy, Marcus, offered Zephyrion the finest stall in the house before you spent the early morning hours exploring the waking town. Zephyrion secured a complimentary hoof-trim and brand-new shoes by recounting his epic deeds, while Rhy-At established a holy shrine to the five gods under a large tree, consecrating the ground.</p>
<p>As the tavern came to life, so did the whispers of your destination. You were welcomed with cheers and free drinks, but the mood shifted as you sought information on the Dead Falls. Alexios, a former smuggler, spoke in hushed tones of a partner lost to the falls, of passages that flood without warning, and a ghost ship sighted in a hidden inlet. His words were a chilling omen, though his paranoia didn't stop Kain from haggling him down with masterful skill to acquire a magical <em>Goblin Mask</em> for a steal. More warnings came from Corax the hunter, who spoke of a deathly silence that falls at midnight, of canyon walls that look like screaming faces, and his unnerving certainty that they <em>breathe</em>.</p>
<p>Amidst the grim portents, the tavern was alive with character. Zephyrion, in a display of pure, unadulterated confidence, received a... <em>thorough</em> glistening with scented oils from the merchant Philomena. Nikandros brought a smile to the face of the grieving war widow, Margot, over a game of cards, unknowingly earning the ire of a jealous onlooker.</p>
<p>You now stand on the precipice, the boisterous life of the Sour Vintage behind you and the chilling, supernatural tales of the Dead Falls echoing in your minds. The path ahead is treacherous, the warnings are dire, and the legendary ghost ship <em>Ultros</em> awaits.</p>
