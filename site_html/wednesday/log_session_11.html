<h1 id="session-11">Session 11</h1>
<ul>
<li>The party debates the merits of escorting the two centaurs outside to the river  </li>
<li>We tell them to head out past the waterfall. It's only a 15 minute walk to the river  </li>
<li>We explore further into the troglodyte caves and the stench is overwhelming  </li>
<li>We discover various dens, but they all seem to have been hastily  evacuated while we were fighting the hoard of them further up near the entrance.  </li>
<li>We snoop around the primitive throne room and find several bars of adamantine buried behind the primitive throne  </li>
<li>We remember that there is an ornamented brass door of dwarven construction back north in the dwarven part of the mine  </li>
<li>We realize it is a dwarven brass elevator with dragon heads decorating it. There is a dwarven inscription next to the elevator, but only Kalian can read dwarvish and he tells us that the inscription says he need to drink alcohol when descending in the elevator  </li>
<li>We decide to go outside and see if we can summon the centaurs to pickup their friends  </li>
<li>We sound the ivory horn and hear the sound of it echo around the river and mountains  </li>
<li>Thirty minutes later we can hear the sound of hoofbeats off in the distance echo down the mountain  </li>
<li>The centaurs are here in full force and their chieftain greets us warmly seeing that we have recovered his two kinsman  </li>
<li>He rewards us each with a greater potion of heroism for our valorous deeds. He hopes that sydon watches over our steps.   </li>
<li>Kain, the ranger, and Demetrius, the Bard, want a larger reward and tell the chieftain that this battle was not easily won and we faced a hoard of foes to rescue his kinsman. They succeed in their plee, and the chieftain agrees to sweeten the deal with a potion of greater healing each. The party thanks the chietain and his tribe and they gallop off into the sunset.  </li>
<li>The party decides to bed down for the night near the edge of the river bank, but in an area that will not be easily discovered by passerbys  </li>
<li>We sleep through the night without incident  </li>
<li>During our rest Ari, investigates the Dwarvish artifact that she found while looting the ruins. When it is filled with water, the fine runes on it glow briefly, transforming the water into delicious dwarvish fortified Ale of high alcohol content.  </li>
<li>The next day, we decide to go investigate the elevator.   </li>
<li>Kalian, the sorcerer tells Kain that he needs to drink from the dwarven mug in order to fullfill the command in the dwarven inscription next to the elevator  </li>
<li>Kain greedily laps up several glasses of the fortified dwarven beer and comes to the edge of drunkenness  </li>
<li>The party gets into the elevator and begins their descent  </li>
<li>They hear liquid moving through the walls around the cabin  </li>
<li>We examine the dragon heads and realize there is a mechanism in their mouths where gas or liquid could expel into the interior of the elevator carriage  </li>
<li>They decide to reverse the elevator and the sound of liquid decelerates  </li>
<li>Back at the top Kalian tells the truth about what the inscription actually says  </li>
<li><em>Carved in angular dwarven script, worn by centuries but still legible:</em>  </li>
<li>"Three breaths of dragon's grace, Then comes the black embrace. When darkness flows from high, Red children dance and fly. Speak friend, or feed the flame - The path up and down's the same.‚Äù  </li>
<li>We decide to descend again and try to guess "the password".   </li>
<li>Several passwords are guessed, but finally somebody.. ahem. . Kain - says "dragon" in Dwarvish and this causes the sound of liquid to decelerate  </li>
<li>The elevator descends several hundred feet to the bottom floor  </li>
<li>In the next room there is a large circular pool of lava with some kind of creature swimming around in it  </li>
<li>Next to the pool of lava is a bronze sphere with a spout pointing toward the pool of lava  </li>
<li>Two death dogs are lazily hanging out next to the bronze sphere  </li>
<li>The  party decides to take out the death dogs before they can get in our way. Arrows and magic fly across the room, slaying the dogs  </li>
<li>We investigate the bronze sphere and realize it has some sort of mechanism  </li>
<li>We also go to investigate the pool of lava and a large creature emerges  </li>
<li>She introduces herself as Pyra the forgekeeper, who has been bound here by the "cursed dwarves" who she claims tricked her into serving them  </li>
<li>She also tells us that this cursed bronze sphere has entrapped her in this pool of lava as it will expel nasty gouts of icy cold onto her, killing her if she leaves the pool  </li>
<li>She encourages the heroes to carefully dismantled the device so she can exit the pool  </li>
<li>She promises to help the party for one year, if they will dismantle the bronze sphere and destroy the tablet which binds her to this place  </li>
<li>She also warns about the giant dog in the next room, where her tablet is hidden  </li>
<li>The cerberus like creature was sent here by Lutheria to torment her and to guard the mine to make sure that it cannot be used again to forge weapons that can be turned against the Titans  </li>
<li>While this is happening, Ari discovers a powerful magical triton in the old dwarven armory  </li>
<li>Down in the south, Kain is sneaking around and discovers a glowing kopis, and then sneaks up to a dock which is behind the waterfall. There is a lever, which diverts the flow of water, so that a gap in the waterfall is formed allowing watercraft to enter  the dock  </li>
<li>Ari examines the bronze sphere and realizes that its mechanism can be "jammed" temporarily with her thieves tools  </li>
<li>Pyra warns that the party has a limited time to dispose of the bronze sphere before it "explodes" in an icy sphere  </li>
<li>The party decides to jam the mechanism and then roll the 1000 pound device into the lair of the young cerberus into the dormant "blast furnace".   </li>
<li>The beefy party members, the minotaur Tharok and the strong centaur Zephyrion manhandle the bronze sphere onto its side and roll it into the blast furnace. Each round they have to roll and athletics check and a stealth check to avoid waking the giant beast  </li>
<li>As they roll the machine into the room, one of them fails their check, making a large clanking sound as they roll the device.  </li>
<li>The giant creature awakens and angrily begins to interrogate our beefcake heroes  </li>
<li>Tharok and Zephyrion, decide to get the hell out of there and the the bronze sphere explodes in a gout of icy death  </li>
<li>The giant three headed dog is wounded by the explosion, but angered by the injury  </li>
<li>He leaps into action, and brutally lays Tharok low,  </li>
<li>The rest of  the party keeps their distance and attacks him from range  </li>
<li>Pyra emerges from her pool of lava and wraps here mighty tail around the great dog, grappling it  </li>
<li>The party continues to throw everything they have at the beast  </li>
<li>Finally Zephyrion lands a brutal blow on the creature, laying it to eternal rest, there were many critical hits</li>
</ul>
