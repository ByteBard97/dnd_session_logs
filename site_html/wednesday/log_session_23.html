<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> Sunday, 2nd week, morning.  </li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Mytros Sewers â€“ Thieves' Guild ("Cult of the Snake") Hideout (LL10), then northern sewer tunnels, culminating at a cellar entrance to the Temple of Lutheria.  </li>
<li><strong>Thieves' Guild Hideout Interaction:</strong>  </li>
<li>Successfully bluffed entry into the main common room/tavern area of the "Cult of the Snake" hideout.  </li>
<li>Met key guild members: Vassilos (leader), Daskalos (lieutenant), Mira, Grigor the Gut, Petros the Rat, and Sister Eudoxia. Lydia was also present.  </li>
<li>Kain observed Bronsidon, an adamantine pill-bug automaton, guarding the vault. Rhy-At identified it as a creation of Volkan.  </li>
<li>Learned the guild steals wine from the Cult of Lutheria but is wary of them and denied knowledge of smuggled children.  </li>
<li>Party members cleaned up after sewer exploration.  </li>
<li>Took a long rest in the hideout; Rhy-At and Kain stood watch.  </li>
<li>Morning: Andrew Lynx gave Lydia Klax's (looted) amulet in an attempt to placate her; she remained distressed.  </li>
<li>Received directions from Grigor to find the Cult of Lutheria by heading north from the hideout.  </li>
<li>Exited the hideout via a ladder Grigor showed them, leading to an alley behind the Siren's Roost.  </li>
<li><strong>Sewer Exploration North:</strong>  </li>
<li>Kain manipulated sluice gates to manage water levels.  </li>
<li>Kain detected an invisible presence near a ladder.  </li>
<li>Andrew Lynx cast Dispel Magic, revealing a Shield Guardian marked with Lutheria's symbols.  </li>
<li>Rhy-At and Andrew identified it as a powerful sentinel with blindsight, immunities, spell storing, and regeneration.  </li>
<li><strong>Combat: Shield Guardian:</strong>  </li>
<li>Party failed to provide the correct password/riddle response ("Dreamers halt before the ladies' veil parts. Recite the lullaby that stoppers with minds speak or drown in violets.").  </li>
<li>Initiated combat with a surprise attack (Nicandros, Andrew, Kain successful on stealth).  </li>
<li>Shield Guardian regenerated and cast Black Tentacles, restraining most of the party. Andrew Lynx failed a counterspell attempt.  </li>
<li>Rhy-At used Mind Sliver then quickened Magic Missiles to break the Guardian's concentration on Black Tentacles.  </li>
<li>Tharok, in a rage, dealt the final blows.  </li>
<li><strong>Loot &amp; Discovery:</strong>  </li>
<li>Zephyrion claimed the Shield Guardian's head (for spell-storing).  </li>
<li>Kain successfully used Thieves' Tools to extract the Shield Guardian Breastplate (crafting component). Failed to salvage the spell-storing plate.  </li>
<li>Ascended the ladder the Guardian was protecting.  </li>
<li><strong>Cult of Lutheria Cellar:</strong>  </li>
<li>Discovered a magically silenced chamber with iron-barred cells.  </li>
<li>Several children were visible, imprisoned within the cells. This is believed to be the cellar of the Temple of Lutheria.  </li>
<li><strong>Cliffhanger:</strong> The party faces the choice of rescuing the children immediately or continuing to explore the sewers.</li>
