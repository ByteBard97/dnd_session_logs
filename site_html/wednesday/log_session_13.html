<ul>
<li>We are meeting with the Knights of King Acastus  </li>
<li>Dragon guys want us to meet the king  </li>
<li>We ask them to help us with the basilisks and they agree  </li>
<li>The gang heads to the sacrifice rock and searches around  </li>
<li>We notice that they're up river, and we walk up the river to find out what's going on - we notice something  </li>
<li>We find a bunch of stone animals in a ring, in the center is a stone tablet, and it appears they were placed there deliberately   </li>
<li>We find some copper poison stuff serpents bane, and collect some  </li>
<li>Then we talk to a dwarf fishing the river and he seems to think the baskies are nearby  </li>
<li>Zeph gives him money for a new fishing rod  </li>
<li>We also find some poison reeds - Crimson Tipped Reeds - Kain has them  </li>
<li>The gang meets a merchant and buys a bunch of stuff  </li>

</li>
<li>Zeph  <ul>
<li>1 live chicken  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The gang finds the entrance to a cave - claw marks at the entrance  </li>
<li>Nik shoots off some fireworks to draw the dragon riders  </li>
<li>We tell them to hang out inside the cave and hide because there are also centaurs coming  </li>
<li>The party deceives the centaurs into believing we are drunk and partying before we die at the sacrifice tomorrow, so they leave  </li>
<li>Kain heads into the cave and finds some slugs  </li>
<li>Kain shoots a slug and its time. For. COMBAT!  </li>
<li>One slug dies and we end combat because the other slugs don't seem to care  </li>
<li>Kal harvests the slug mucus (can be used as coagulant or alchemical reagent)  </li>
<li>In front of the entrance was a symbol with a broken chain  </li>
<li>Nik finds a badge with a broken chain symbol on it  </li>
<li>There was a resistance group called the oath keepers, resisting Sydon, distant relative Damaclese Arkalander lead this group  </li>
<li>Kain finds the baskies and tells Tharok  </li>
<li>Tharok peers into the cave using the bronze mirror to look, and tosses a chicken into the cave with a rope tied to it  </li>
<li>The basilisk chases the chicken while Tharok runs   </li>
<li>The baski chases and the gang fights!  </li>
<li>We kill one baskie - Nik extracts the baskie gullet and it has some magical properties  </li>
<li>Kain heads back into the cave to investigate more - there are some glimmerfin tetras- they are sensitive to temperature changes  </li>
<li>Kain finds a stone human hand and some more slugs  </li>
<li>A human man, stone, holding an axe  </li>
<li>Also a large baskie, with its mate  </li>
<li>There's a lot of stuff in the cave as though it was a settlement  </li>
<li>Kain lures the baskies out  </li>
<li>TIME FOR COMBAT!  </li>
<li>Everyone lights up the baskies as they come out  </li>
<li>We killed the alpha, and a baskie  </li>
<li>Plan for next session - finish the baskies, loot the cave, tell the town we are awesome and come watch us not get sacrificed, get the hammer and give damaged items to volkan</li>
</ul>
