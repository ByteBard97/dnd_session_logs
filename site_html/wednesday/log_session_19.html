<p><strong>Session Log: 2025-04-16</strong></p>
<p><strong>Palace Aftermath &amp; New Allies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Following the dispersal of Sydon's storm, the party rested briefly in the Great Palace. The time was approximately 4 AM.  </li>
<li>Queen Vallus introduced Rhy-At, a Warforged sorcerer, as her emissary to the party.  </li>
<li>Vallus rewarded the heroes with a Scarab of Protection, which was given to Tharok.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stygian Row Excursion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Seeking leads on the Lady of Coins and the Cult of Lutheria, the party ventured into the Stygian Row slum before dawn.  </li>
<li>Kain pursued and apprehended a goatling informant named Nippins after it threw a coin at him. Nippins confirmed the Lady of Coins used the sewers and suggested visiting the Satyr's Tail tavern for more information. Kain tasked Nippins with becoming a contact.  </li>
<li>The party arrived at the Satyr's Tail tavern, a rough establishment frequented by sailors and criminals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Satyr's Tail Interactions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Zephyrion clashed with the barkeep, Julius, over decorum and potent liquor, eventually getting ejected after a failed intimidation led to defecating on the floor.  </li>
<li>Tharok engaged a minotaur crewman (Cepheus) of Captain Varkon in arm wrestling, winning easily.  </li>
<li>Tharok learned Varkon's ship is the "Moist Maiden" and that they sometimes transport goods and people for Hexia.  </li>
<li>Kain met his contact, Melandra, who identified Trellis and Septia (present in the tavern) as Lutherian cultists using their wine merchant business as a cover. Melandra also shared rumors about the Order of Sydon's wealth originating from the Isle of Yonder and pointed out two suspected enforcers of the Lady of Coins. Kain tasked Melandra with spreading anti-Lutheria rumors.  </li>
<li>Andrew Lynx obtained Trellis and Septia's warehouse address by feigning interest in buying wine. His attempt to cause chaos with a Minor Illusion (shouting "Guards!") only caused one unrelated thief (Delphinius) to flee.  </li>
<li>Kain apprehended Delphinius outside, learned he had a 100gp bounty, and tasked him with stealing a map to Hexia's Island from the Moist Maiden in exchange for not collecting the bounty. (Subsequent dice roll indicated Delphinius's failure).  </li>
<li>Tharok collaborated with the satyr bard Fryxon (with Kyra's help) to compose and perform "The Storm's End," a ballad praising the heroes and subtly denigrating Lutheria.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Agora Marketplace (Around 8 AM):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The party proceeded to the Agora marketplace.  </li>
<li>They visited Talia's shop. She thanked them profusely for rescuing her, offered a 25% discount, and gave them a gift (contents unspecified).  </li>
<li>The party purchased 6 Potions of Greater Healing and 7 Potions of Heroism from Talia. Kain bought 2 Oils of Sharpness, 2 nets, caltrops, and a grappling hook.  </li>
<li>Kain acquired a regular shield and equipped the party's Mithril Breastplate, upgrading his AC to 17. He also attuned to the Radiance of Mitros short sword.  </li>
<li>They visited the Great Menagerie, run by The Collector.  </li>
<li>Using persuasion and deception, Andrew Lynx and Rhy-At convinced The Collector that a caged young centaur, Kalon, was diseased, securing his release.  </li>
<li>The party sold two Basilisk eggs to The Collector for 4400gp (220pp).  </li>
<li>Rhy-At healed Kalon, lectured him on theft, and Kain gave him gold.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lord Taran's Offer:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While in the Agora, the party was approached by a messenger from Lord Taran Neurdagon, summoning them to his estate near noon.  </li>
<li>They met Lord Taran, a wealthy noble and known minotaur slave trader.  </li>
<li>Taran offered the party 5,000gp for the head of the Lady of Coins, whom he blamed for disrupting his business.  </li>
<li>After negotiation, the party secured a deal for 6,000gp plus six Potions of Stone to Flesh/Flesh to Stone for the Lady of Coins' head.  </li>
<li>They noted the presence of Cepheus, an associate of Taran wearing the blue cloak of the Order of Sydon.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The party decided their next immediate objective is to investigate the Cult of Lutheria's warehouse, using the address provided by Trellis and Septia.<br />
