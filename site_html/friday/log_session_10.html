<p><strong>Session 10 Recap: The Fires of the Mithral Forge</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Battle in the Dwarven Hall</strong>  </li>
<li>After your stealthy approach faltered, you faced off against vicious death dogs feasting on the colossal corpse of a three-headed cerberus.  </li>
<li>The death dogs lunged, their diseased bites infecting Delphi.  </li>
<li>Together, you vanquished the beasts, cutting down the last one as it tried to flee.  </li>
<li>The air hung heavy with the scent of decay and ancient dust.  </li>
<li><strong>Exploring the Dwarven Quarters</strong>  </li>
<li>Venturing into the abandoned living quarters, you sifted through rubble and relics of a bygone era.  </li>
<li>Amidst the debris, you uncovered hidden treasures—glimmers of mithral and ancient dwarven craftsmanship overlooked by the troglodytes.  </li>
<li>The silent halls whispered tales of the dwarves who once toiled here, their presence felt in every stone.  </li>
<li><strong>The Menace of the Cockatrices</strong>  </li>
<li>Proceeding cautiously, you heard unsettling, chicken-like squawks echoing through the corridors.  </li>
<li>Aella scouted ahead, discovering an old storage room filled with rotten sacks and broken crates—a remnant of the mine's operational days.  </li>
<li>Further down, she spotted the Bird Pens: a chilling scene with a petrified troglodyte and a cockatrice lurking nearby.  </li>
<li>Formulating a plan, you barricaded the doorway with Rheana's help, using old crates to trap the creature inside.  </li>
<li><strong>Confrontation in the Barracks</strong>  </li>
<li>Across the hall, you encountered three more death dogs turned to stone, guarded by two vigilant cockatrices.  </li>
<li>The cockatrices screeched and attacked, their beady eyes glowing with arcane menace.  </li>
<li>Aella narrowly avoided their petrifying gaze before you swiftly dispatched them, ensuring the safety of the passage.  </li>
<li><strong>The Deceptive Elevator Trap</strong>  </li>
<li>Returning to the dwarven elevator, you noticed a hastily scribbled note in Dwarvish near the door—a cryptic reminder about a password.  </li>
<li>Trusting the troglodyte king's word, you recited "Barazgul" (meaning "mithral") as you descended.  </li>
<li>Alarms blared as oil began seeping from dragon-shaped spouts—realizing too late that the king had deceived you.  </li>
<li>Thinking quickly, Delphi reversed the elevator's direction, ascending as the flow of oil subsided.  </li>
<li>Determined to outsmart the trap, you clogged the dragon mouths with debris, reducing the impending flames' impact.  </li>
<li>The elevator descended once more; flames erupted but were dampened by your quick thinking, allowing you to reach the lower levels singed but alive.  </li>
<li><strong>The Silent Armory</strong>  </li>
<li>Stepping into a vast armory once brimming with legendary weapons, you found only echoes of the past.  </li>
<li>Empty racks and shattered armaments told stories of looting and time's relentless decay.  </li>
<li>Despite thorough searching, valuable relics eluded you, perhaps hidden or long removed.  </li>
<li><strong>Encounter with the Forgekeeper</strong>  </li>
<li>Moving south, you discovered a grand chamber dominated by a bubbling pool of lava—a creature swam beneath its molten surface.  </li>
<li>Two death dogs guarded an enigmatic bronze sphere with a protruding spout.  </li>
<li>Without hesitation, Aella led the charge against the guardians.  </li>
<li>Rheana invoked the <strong>Fear of the Dragonlords</strong>, her presence unsettling the death dogs and giving you the upper hand.  </li>
<li>Upon their defeat, a serpentine figure emerged from the lava—the salamander known as Pyra, the Forgekeeper.  </li>
<li>She warned of the enchanted sphere, a deadly trap designed by the dwarves to keep her bound.  </li>
<li><strong>Disarming the Frozen Trap</strong>  </li>
<li>Investigating the sphere, you attempted to disable it but only delayed its activation.  </li>
<li>As ominous clicks sounded, Pyra urged you to flee before a blast of freezing magic engulfed the room.  </li>
<li>Refusing to be thwarted, you heaved the sphere onto Rheana's sturdy back.  </li>
<li>With a combined effort, you hurled it over the edge, watching as it plummeted into the waterfall below—its icy explosion freezing the cascading waters momentarily.  </li>
<li><strong>Alliance with Pyra</strong>  </li>
<li>Grateful for your intervention, Pyra introduced herself and revealed her plight.  </li>
<li>Tricked by the dwarves, she had been bound to power the forge for centuries.  </li>
<li>She offered to reignite the legendary Mithral Forge if you agreed to destroy the rune tablet anchoring her to this place.  </li>
<li>Pyra cautioned you about the young cerberus ahead, a fearsome guardian sent by Lutheria herself.  </li>
<li>She suggested diplomacy but remained ready to assist in battle if needed.  </li>
<li><strong>The Fierce Battle with the Cerberus</strong>  </li>
<li>Undeterred, Delphi approached the cerberus, attempting to negotiate.  </li>
<li>The beast snarled, its three heads echoing with malice, and vowed to devour you all.  </li>
<li>The fight was brutal—the cerberus's powerful jaws and venomous bites pushed you to your limits.  </li>
<li>Pyra joined the fray, ensnaring the creature with her fiery tail and encasing one of its heads in hardened magma.  </li>
<li>Amidst the chaos, several of you suffered grievous wounds and the sting of poison.  </li>
<li>In a final, decisive move, Delphi unleashed a scorching firebolt, striking down the monstrous hound.  </li>
<li><strong>Liberation and Rekindling the Forge</strong>  </li>
<li>Among the cerberus's hoard, you found treasures and the rune tablet binding Pyra.  </li>
<li>Honoring your promise, Delphi shattered the tablet; Pyra sighed with relief as the ancient bonds dissolved.  </li>
<li>In gratitude, she descended into the depths, her fiery essence merging with the forge's heart.  </li>
<li>The Mithral Forge roared back to life—the chambers illuminated by the glow of molten metal and the rhythmic pulse of ancient machinery.  </li>
<li>As you caught your breath, the distant sound of gears turning signaled the elevator's activation.  </li>
<li><strong>Something—or someone—was descending from above, drawn by the forge's awakening...</strong></li>
</ul>
