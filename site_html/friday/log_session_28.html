<ul>
<li>The party landed on the small, statue-covered island in the eastern bay of Themis, believed to be a key location for the usurpers.  </li>
<li>The island features numerous marble statues, primarily of naked men, some appearing scarred or maimed, with a central marble staircase leading down into the earth.  </li>
<li>The Jancan, Steros, is with the party, hoping to find his father, Bront, who he believes is held captive on Themis.  </li>
<li>Four marble statues (golems) at the top of the staircase animate and attack when men (Delphi or Astraeus) approach, but remain inert for women (Aella, Rhaena, Makaira).  </li>
<li>The golems were discovered to regenerate damage unless their parts were removed and scattered. Dismembering them, particularly removing the head, was key to their defeat.  </li>
<li>Delphi's owl scouted beyond the brass doors at the bottom of the staircase and observed two Amazon warriors inside, seemingly relaxed and playing a game.  </li>
<li>Aella's Stimfay surveyed the island's exterior and found two potential alternative entrances:  </li>
<li>A large, half-submerged stone culvert or pipe.  </li>
<li>A narrow crack in the cliff face, currently at high tide, which might become accessible in approximately three hours as the tide recedes.  </li>
<li>The party chose to confront the marble golems directly rather than wait for the tide or attempt the culvert.  </li>
<li>After a difficult battle, all four marble golems were destroyed.  </li>
<li>The brass doors leading into the Amazon's secret temple complex are now accessible to the party.  </li>
<li>The party is battered and likely needs a short rest before proceeding further into the complex.  </li>
<li>The DM indicated the party will level up upon successfully clearing the island of Themis.  </li>
<li>This island is a significant step in Aella's epic path as "The Exile," marking her return to her homeland to confront those who usurped her mother's throne.</li>
