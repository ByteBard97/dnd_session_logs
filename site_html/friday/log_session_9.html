<p>Log<br />
<strong>Arrival at the Great Falls of Arkelon</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The party reached the breathtaking <strong>Great Falls of Arkelon</strong>, where the river cascades into a vast lake surrounded by colossal statues known as the <strong>Hands of Kentimane</strong>, the Elder Titan.  </li>
<li>As they marveled at the sight, they noticed <strong>disgusting troglodytes</strong> climbing a rope ladder along the waterfall's side.<br />
<strong>Clash at the Waterfall</strong>  </li>
<li>Without hesitation, the heroes engaged the troglodytes in a fierce battle on the slippery cliffs beneath the roaring waterfall.  </li>
<li>One troglodyte escaped inside the caves, sounding an alarm that brought more creatures rushing to the fray.  </li>
<li>A full-scale skirmish erupted at the cave entrance, but the party held their ground.<br />
<strong>Venturing into the Troglodyte Caves</strong>  </li>
<li>Entering the <strong>foul-smelling caverns</strong>, the heroes were assaulted by an overwhelming stench.  </li>
<li>Navigating the dark tunnels, they remained vigilant for ambushes from troglodytes known to camouflage against the cave walls.<br />
<strong>Rescue of the Captured Centaurs</strong>  </li>
<li>They stumbled upon a horrific scene: a centaur being <strong>cooked alive over a pit</strong> by several troglodytes.  </li>
<li>Swiftly defeating the beasts, the heroes saved two centaurs, <strong>Kaluk</strong> and <strong>Hirak</strong>.  </li>
<li><strong>Hirak</strong> was near death but was revived with <strong>goodberries</strong> provided by the party.  </li>
<li>The grateful centaurs warned of the <strong>intelligent troglodyte king</strong> deeper within the caves and cautioned about the creatures' chameleon-like abilities.  </li>
<li>Before departing to reunite with their tribe, they reminded the heroes to <strong>blow the ivory horn</strong> upon leaving to receive their promised reward.<br />
<strong>Stealthy Assaults and Cave Navigation</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>Aella</strong> took the lead, stealthily moving through the darkness and <strong>silently eliminating two troglodytes</strong> with her chakram.  </li>
<li>The party carefully navigated the winding passages, aware of potential ambushes and traps set by the cunning creatures.  </li>
<li><strong>Delphi's</strong> keen senses and magical prowess aided in detecting hidden enemies.<br />
<strong>Confrontation with the Troglodyte King</strong>  </li>
<li>Deep within the caverns, Aella discovered the <strong>troglodyte king</strong>, a towering figure wearing a <strong>golden circlet</strong>—a headband that granted him unnatural intelligence.  </li>
<li>Seizing the moment, she attacked from the shadows, wounding him severely.  </li>
<li>The enraged king summoned his minions, and a tense battle ensued.  </li>
<li><strong>Delphi</strong> cleverly cast a <strong>web spell</strong>, blocking two pathways and preventing reinforcements from overwhelming the party.<br />
<strong>The Riddle Challenge</strong>  </li>
<li>Recognizing the stalemate, the troglodyte king proposed a contest:  </li>
<li>If the heroes could answer his <strong>three riddles</strong>, he would surrender his <strong>mithral scepter</strong>, grant them safe passage into the dwarven mines, and share a valuable secret.  </li>
<li>Accepting the challenge, the party listened intently and, through teamwork and wit, <strong>correctly answered all three riddles</strong>.  </li>
<li>True to his word, the king handed over the scepter and revealed the secret:  </li>
<li>The <strong>dwarven elevator ahead was trapped</strong> and required the dwarvish password "<strong>Barazgul</strong>" (meaning "mithral") to deactivate the deadly mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A Tense Departure and Moral Conflict</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As the heroes prepared to leave, Aella noticed the king's <strong>smug smirk</strong>, suspecting deceit.  </li>
<li>Feeling disrespected, she <strong>demanded the rest of his treasures</strong>.  </li>
<li>Reluctantly, the king surrendered his gold and mithral ingots but <strong>refused to part with his magical circlet</strong>.  </li>
<li><strong>Kyra</strong> warned that breaking their agreement could damage their reputation and <strong>erode trust among allies</strong>.<br />
<strong>Rest and Reflection</strong>  </li>
<li>Outside the caves, the party took a <strong>short rest</strong> to recuperate.  </li>
<li><strong>Delphi attuned to the scepter</strong>, which emitted a mysterious black glow in the fading light.  </li>
<li>They contemplated the moral implications of their actions, weighing the pursuit of justice against the value of honor.<br />
<strong>Exploring the Upper Levels of the Mithral Mines</strong>  </li>
<li>Re-entering the caves, they noticed that the <strong>two-headed dog statue</strong> that once guarded a stone bridge was <strong>no longer there</strong>.  </li>
<li>Sending <strong>Delphi's owl familiar</strong> ahead, they observed:  </li>
<li>A <strong>great chasm</strong> plunging into the earth—the <strong>Deep Shaft</strong> leading to the lower mines.  </li>
<li><strong>Death dogs</strong>—vicious two-headed hounds—gnawing on the <strong>corpse of a massive three-headed cerberus</strong>, hinting at the deadly creatures that now inhabited the mines.  </li>
<li>An <strong>ornate bronze elevator of dwarven construction</strong>, adorned with intricate engravings and ancient craftsmanship.  </li>
<li>The owl spotted a <strong>hastily scribbled note in dwarvish</strong> near the elevator but couldn't get close enough to read it.</li>
</ul>
