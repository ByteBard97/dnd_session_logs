<ul>
<li>Agenda</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Approach the Temple of the Oracle:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Upon arriving at the temple, notice the presence of soldiers at the entrance. Decide on the best way to approach themâ€”whether through conversation, stealth, or another tactic.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Investigate the Soldiers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Engage with the soldiers to learn why they are stationed at the temple. Use diplomacy, intimidation, or subterfuge to uncover more about their purpose and intentions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explore the Temple:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As you enter the temple, be on the lookout for anything unusual. Search the area, interact with any temple attendants, and pay attention to any signs of distress or clues that might reveal what's happening inside.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Uncover the Situation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Through exploration and interaction, gather information about the current state of the temple and the Oracle. You may find that something is amiss, prompting further investigation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Meet with the Oracle:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As you delve deeper into the temple, your goal is to find the Oracle, Versi, and receive her prophecy. Be prepared for any challenges or unexpected encounters along the way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Plan Your Next Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After meeting with the Oracle and learning about your next objectives, discuss as a party which of the Great Labors you will pursue first. Consider whether to swear the Oath of Fellowship to solidify your unity.  </li>
<li>We start in the Cavern next to the Temple guarded by what appear to be soldiers of Sydon  </li>
<li>The party attacks the soldiers guarding the temple  </li>
<li>One soldier ran inside the temple to warn his comrades.  </li>
<li>More Soldiers came out of the temple and attacked the party!  </li>
<li>We defeated them and confronted the evil Acolyte of Sydon, Braeca.  </li>
<li>He warned us not to continue any further, but we slit his throat  </li>
<li>The remaining temple attendants thanks us  </li>
<li>They warned us that the Oracle below has been captured by a crone of powerful magical means  </li>
<li>The party convinced Proteus the temple attendant to hand over 4 healing potions to the party  </li>
<li>We readied ourselves to go further into the temple and free the Oracle</li>
</ul>
