<p>Agenda</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aella:</strong> Gather allies and return to the Isle of Themis and overthrow the usurpers who murdered your mother and stole her throne  </li>
<li><strong>Astreus:</strong> Queen Vallus has guided you to seek out the Lotus Witch, who may possess the fabled grimoire you need for your chronicles. She also suggested consulting the Fates, who could craft an artifact to help ensure you live to tell your tale.  </li>
<li><strong>Delphi:</strong> Xander gave you your crown and his mystic armaments. Your fabled armor has been stolen by Gaius, the commander of the Order of Sydon. He keeps your armor in his fortress on the Island of Yonder, which is heavily fortified. Versi told you about a brass dragon egg on Fire Island.  </li>
<li><strong>Rhaena:</strong> You have recovered your family ring, a lost artifact tied to your erased past. The whispers of your Mother urge you onward—to seek the greater family artifact held by the Amazon Queen, somewhere in the Cerulean sea.</li>
</ul>
<p>Log</p>
<ul>
<li>The waters of the Dead Falls churned as you faced the legendary Dragonlord, Estor Arkelander. What began as a negotiation quickly devolved into an epic battle, with the ghost captain teleporting across his vessel, determined to claim one of you as his next vessel. The three Thanes—Metron the Navigator, Skathon the First Mate, and Davos the Quartermaster—honored their alliance with you, keeping the spectral crew at bay while joining your fight against their former captain.  </li>
<li>With a thunderous crack, Estor's ghostly form collapsed under your combined assault, only to rise again as a towering skeletal monstrosity. The enchanted weapons of the ship—an animated armor and flying sword—rallied to your cause as you battled the undead Dragonlord. Through skill, determination, and no small amount of courage, you finally banished Estor's form.  </li>
<li>As he faded from the helm of the Ultros, his hollow voice echoed across the deck: "You may claim this ship, but know this: you cannot be rid of me so easily."  </li>
<li>In the aftermath of battle, you encountered the true heart of the vessel—Delphia, the dryad whose life was sacrificed to form the ship's mast. Her ethereal form explained the Ultros' mysterious workings and its ability to travel beneath the waters. Under her guidance, the ship dove beneath the dark waters of the Dead Falls, emerging moments later into the gleaming expanse of the Cerulean Gulf.  </li>
<li>Your first destination was not Mytros, but the Mithral Forge upriver along the Arkelon. There you delivered the precious mithral bars needed to repair the Keledone, ensuring that Volkan and Pyra's divine craftsmanship would eventually reach your hands. Only then did you set course for the city of Mytros—though wisdom guided your decision to anchor offshore, away from prying eyes.  </li>
<li>Under cover of discretion, you entered the city and sought audience with Queen Vallus. The Goddess of Wisdom received you warmly, presenting you with the Antikythera—an ancient navigational device that would guide your journey through the treacherous waters of Thylea. She revealed its crucial flaw: a missing gear that limited its functionality to the Cerulean Gulf, unable to chart paths into the more dangerous Forgotten Sea. The missing component, she informed you, was likely hidden on the Island of Yonder, guarded by Sydon's faithful.  </li>
<li>Her expression grave, Queen Vallus delivered her most urgent warning: "You have but two short months before the Oath of Peace comes to an end: sixty days to confront Sydon in his tower at Praxys, and Lutheria on her throne in the Nether Sea. If you cannot renew the Oath of Peace in that time, then I fear to think of what will befall this city. The armies of the Titans will slaughter the people of Mytros and soak the land in blood."  </li>
<li>Her eyes gleamed with a fierce determination as she continued, "The Titans are weaker now than they were in the First War. You would be wise to gather what power you can on your journey. With the right weapons and knowledge, perhaps you could even challenge the Titans directly, and destroy them for good."  </li>
<li>King Acastus received your triumphant return with thinly veiled jealousy. Clearly surprised by your survival, he offered cold congratulations while issuing a warning: bring no further troubles to Mytros.  </li>
<li>As word of your impending voyage spread through the city, gifts poured in from the citizens: sacrificial animals, enchanted arrows, and magical potions to aid your journey. One hundred brave souls volunteered to serve as your crew, with fifty required at minimum to man the oars of the mighty vessel.  </li>
<li>Notable allies joined your cause: Pythor, God of Battle, though nursing a substantial hangover, pledged his divine might to your quest. The Amazon warrior Mahkeira signed on, bringing her considerable martial prowess. Queen Vallus entrusted Kyrah with a mysterious bronze casket.  </li>
<li>At the docks, Versi the Oracle sought out Delphi, sharing vital information about a brass dragon egg located on Fire Island—corresponding to the Constellation of the Prisoner. With a kiss and an entreaty to return safely, she blessed his journey, adding yet another quest to your growing list of objectives.  </li>
<li>Now, the legendary ship Ultros cuts through the waters of the Cerulean Gulf, its black sails billowing with favorable winds. The Antikythera is calibrated to the Constellation of the Prisoner, guiding you toward Fire Island, where legends say the Goddess of Swiftness remains trapped in eternal torment at the heart of a volcanic prison.</li>
