<h3 id="recap-of-session-16:-&quot;through-the-storm-and-shadows&quot;"><strong>Recap of Session 16: "Through the Storm and Shadows"</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Descent from Mount Volkan:</strong>  </li>
<li>After dispelling Sydon's hurricane with the power of the <strong>Boreal Harp</strong>, the heroes began their descent from <strong>Mount Volkan</strong>, a place steeped in divine significance as the namesake of <strong>Volkan, the God of Forges</strong>. The mountain's harsh cliffs and storms tested their resolve one last time.  </li>
<li>They stumbled upon the <strong>nest of a wyvern pair</strong>, but their attempt to sneak past failed. The <strong>female wyvern attacked</strong>, knocking <strong>Aella</strong> down the mountainside and leaving her clinging to life. <strong>Rhena</strong>, with the help of her dragon companion <strong>Nyssi</strong>, took charge, delivering decisive blows to slay the creature.  </li>
<li>The fight grew deadlier when the <strong>male wyvern returned</strong>. <strong>Astreus</strong> narrowly avoided death after being thrown off a ledge, and the party fought desperately to survive. Finally, they emerged victorious, recovering a <strong>golden amulet</strong> and a <strong>wyvern egg</strong>—a hard-won trophy of their courage.  </li>
<li><strong>Return to Mytros:</strong>  </li>
<li>The city of <strong>Mytros</strong> lay battered but not broken as its people worked to recover from Sydon's storm. On the streets, the <strong>Cult of Lutheria</strong> continued its efforts to sway the masses, distributing food and wine to the poor. Though their actions appeared charitable, the heroes knew their intentions were far darker.  </li>
<li>At the palace, <strong>King Acastus</strong> greeted the party warmly, rewarding them with a <strong>map to the Ultros</strong>, a legendary ship that could change the balance of power in Thylea. However, <strong>Queen Vallus</strong> privately warned the heroes of her husband's ambitions. She urged them to keep the ship out of his hands and gifted them a <strong>Scarab of Protection</strong> as a token of her support.  </li>
<li><strong>The Agora and the Great Menagerie:</strong>  </li>
<li>In the bustling <strong>Agora</strong>, the party sought to sell the <strong>wyvern egg</strong>. At the <strong>Great Menagerie</strong>, they encountered <strong>The Collector</strong>, a mysterious figure dealing in exotic creatures. Cages of rare and sorrowful beasts filled the area, reflecting the city's mix of wonder and cruelty.  </li>
<li>The heroes struck a deal, trading the egg for gold and the freedom of <strong>Kaelon</strong>, a captured centaur. Kaelon's story of being abducted by slavers resonated deeply with <strong>Rhena</strong>, whose own family's fate remained shrouded in mystery. His freedom was a small but meaningful victory.  </li>
<li><strong>Rest and Reflection:</strong>  </li>
<li>With the day's trials behind them, the party found brief respite in the palace, thanks to <strong>Queen Vallus's hospitality</strong>. After cleaning up and taking a well-deserved rest, they began preparing for their next steps.  </li>
<li><strong>The Temple of Lutheria:</strong>  </li>
<li>Turning their attention to the <strong>Temple of Lutheria</strong> in <strong>Stygian Row</strong>, the group found it far more refined than its surroundings suggested. The cultists welcomed the poor with food and wine, using these gifts to draw new followers into their fold.  </li>
<li>Posing as new devotees, the party gained entry to the temple. <strong>Delphi's familiar</strong> scouted the wine cellar below, but locked doors and lingering mysteries forced the group to retreat and gather more information before acting further.  </li>
<li><strong>The Satyr's Tail:</strong>  </li>
<li>Seeking answers about the <strong>Cult of the Snake</strong>, the group visited the shady tavern known as <strong>The Satyr's Tail</strong>. Two grizzled brothers shared cryptic information about the cult and its leader, the <strong>Lady of Coins</strong>, who rules over the slums with an iron grip. The brothers' demeanor suggested they were not to be trusted.  </li>
<li>Meanwhile, <strong>Astreus</strong> joined the tavern's performer, <strong>Fryxon</strong>, in a musical duet that won the crowd's favor. Afterward, Fryxon warned the party to be wary of the brothers, who had deep ties to the <strong>Cult of the Snake</strong> and their dangerous leader.</li>
