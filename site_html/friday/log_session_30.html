<h1 id="session-30">Session 30</h1>
<h3 id="rescue-&amp;-alliances"><strong>Rescue &amp; Alliances</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Darian Rescued:</strong> The party freed Aella's childhood friend, Darian, from a magically-silenced prison cell, marking the first major step in reclaiming the throne.  </li>
<li><strong>Allies Gained &amp; Contained:</strong> The captive lizardfolk, Skal and Veth, were freed. The charmed Amazon guard, Talia, was then imprisoned in Darian's former cell to keep her silenced.  </li>
<li><strong>Arming for Vengeance:</strong> The party looted the Amazon barracks, finding treasure (adamantine daggers, platinum), a sailor's map, and several strange items. They used the captured gear to arm the newly-freed Darian and healed her wounds.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="delving-deeper"><strong>Delving Deeper</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strange Encounters:</strong> The party descended further, bypassing a mysterious cobalt-blue fountain and discovering a salon filled with a harem of dazed young men.  </li>
<li><strong>A Demon's Tip:</strong> In a ruined feast hall, the group met Voracia, a bored demon who, for her own amusement, pointed them toward the bedchamber of Leia, one of the medusa usurpers.  </li>
<li><strong>The Lair of the Sister:</strong> Avoiding a trap plate, the party found Leia's opulent room. Inside, the medusa was lounging with a minotaur companion, serenaded by a maenad musician, with the sound of crying infants coming from a nearby cradle.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-ambush-&amp;-the-twist"><strong>The Ambush &amp; The Twist</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perfect Assault:</strong> The party launched a surprise attack, bursting in and quickly gaining the upper hand with a coordinated assault. Aella's chakram hit Leia, Rhaena's spear killed the minotaur, and magic from Astraeus and Delphi blasted the room.  </li>
<li><strong>Petrifying Gaze:</strong> The tide turned when Leia unleashed her power, instantly turning Astraeus and Delphi to stone.  </li>
<li><strong>Deceit Revealed:</strong> The "infants" in the cradle revealed their true forms as goatling tricksters. One of them polymorphed Makaira into a rat.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="victory-from-the-jaws-of-defeat"><strong>Victory from the Jaws of Defeat</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Final Act of Power:</strong> Just as all seemed lost, the stone-bound Delphi unleashed a final, maximized lightning bolt from a scroll, incinerating Leia and one of the goatlings.  </li>
<li><strong>Reversal of Fortune:</strong> With Leia's death, the polymorph spell on Makaira was broken. The remaining enemies, including the second goatling and the maenad musician, immediately surrendered.  </li>
<li><strong>Restoration &amp; Restocking:</strong> The party used their last two doses of basilisk salve to cure Astraeus and Delphi. They then returned to the basilisk pens, killed the remaining beasts, and skillfully harvested a fresh supply of six doses of the petrification antidote.</li>
</ul>
