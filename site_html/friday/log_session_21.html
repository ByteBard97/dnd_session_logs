<p>Log</p>
<ul>
<li>We explored around the ship and met the three Thanes  </li>
<li>Metron the navigator  </li>
<li>Skathon the First Mate  </li>
<li>Davos the Quatermaster  </li>
<li>The navigator had a dragon egg in a box and we had to promise to protect it  </li>
<li>We also promised to free the crew after our voyage was finished in a few months time  </li>
<li>In turn they agreed to keep the crew from joining the captain's fight against us and they agreed to join the fight against the captain  </li>
<li>We went back up to the deck and told Estor Arkalander that we were not going to join as his crew and that we would instead be taking over the ship for ourselves  </li>
<li>A mighty battle was joined  </li>
<li>Estor Teleported around the ship but was eventually laid low by the combined might of the heroes  </li>
<li>However, once downed, he transformed into a giant skeleton  </li>
<li>We got an animated armor and flying sword to help us</li>
</ul>
