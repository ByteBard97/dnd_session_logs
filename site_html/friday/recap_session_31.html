<h2 id="the-hydras-maw-scholars-secrets">The Hydra's Maw &amp; Scholar's Secrets</h2>
<p>From the bloody temple of Themis, your path led directly to the very beast that guarded the queen's deepest secrets â€“ the monstrous Hydra. With a daring plan, Astraeus unleashed a powerful</p>
<p><em>Polymorph</em> spell, transforming the many-headed horror into a confused, ribbiting giant toad. Despite its newfound amphibian form, the toad still proved feisty, but Aella, ever fearless, bravely plunged her hand down its gullet. After a tense moment, she emerged victorious, clutching the legendary</p>
<p><em>Titan's Bane</em>! This +3 adamantine blade is capable of shifting size (shortsword, longsword, or greatsword), dealing devastating necrotic damage (1d6, plus an additional 3d6 against Titans and cyclopes), and even casting</p>
<p><em>dispel magic</em> with every strike! Its adamantine nature allows it to deal double damage against objects and constructs, and it has advantage on saving throws against attempts to damage it.</p>
<p>With the sword secured and the grateful Bront reunited with his son Steros, the</p>
<p><em>Ultros</em> set sail. Your journey brought you once more to the familiar shores of Jazirat Zulhaf, the Turtle Island. Here, you delivered the Perfect Basilisk Eye to the delighted marid, Shazum , and in exchange, received the mysterious</p>
<p><em>Golemstone</em> as a reward. Shazum, ever seeking new curiosities, immediately tasked you with finding the intact stinger and tail of a giant scorpion. He also revealed the true nature of your perplexing red and blue potions: powerful enlarge/reduce draughts with a subtle, yet unknown, side effect. The shimmering pink liquid from Themis was identified as a</p>
<p><em>Potion of Chromatic Displacement</em>, granting the ability to phase through solid objects, resistance to most damage, and translucence.</p>
<p>In the Floating Lantern Inn, you discovered a new visitor: Elara Vancroft, a sharp-witted researcher in "Astro-Geological History" from the Mytrosian Royal Academy. After a cautious exchange, she agreed to trade knowledge: your firsthand accounts of the islands for her meticulous star charts. You confirmed that Fire Island is the Constellation of the Prisoner, and Elara stated the Constellation of the Centaur leads to either</p>
<p><em>Scorpion Island</em> or <em>Indigo Island</em>. You also gained a new, more detailed map of the Cerulean Gulf from the Amazons, which Elara eagerly copied for her research. Elara further shared her belief that the Constellation of the Bard leads to the</p>
<p><em>Isle of the Fates</em> and confirmed the Constellation of the Gygan leads to the <em>Island of Yonder</em> (Gaius's stronghold, where the missing Antikythera gear and Delphi's family armor are located).</p>
<p>With new quests, powerful artifacts, and invaluable intelligence, you now continue your voyage into the unknown, setting course for the island marked by the Constellation of the Centaur.</p>
