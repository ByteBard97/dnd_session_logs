<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conclusion of the Battle with Demetria:</strong>  </li>
<li>Resuming the intense combat in the feasting hall of the Mossy Temple, you faced Demetria, the vengeful dryad, and her formidable gygan guardian.  </li>
<li><strong>Aella</strong> delivered a critical strike against Demetria, severely wounding her.  </li>
<li><strong>Delphi</strong> swiftly cast a sleep spell, successfully rendering Demetria unconscious.  </li>
<li>Seeing an opportunity to avoid further bloodshed, <strong>Astreus</strong> used his silver tongue to persuade the gygan to lay down his arms and flee the battle.  </li>
<li>With the immediate threats neutralized, you securely tied up Demetria to prevent any further mischief.  </li>
<li><strong>Retrieving the Horn of Balmytria:</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>Delphi</strong> retrieved the coveted <strong>Horn of Balmytria</strong> from the feasting table.  </li>
<li>Fulfilling one of your Great Labors, Delphi drank from the horn and immediately fell into a deep, dream-laden slumber.  </li>
<li>You recognized this as a sacred experience linked to your destiny.  </li>
<li><strong>Exploration of the Mossy Temple:</strong>  </li>
<li>While Delphi rested, the rest of you explored the remaining chambers of the temple.  </li>
<li>You discovered Demetria's private quarters, which contained a locked chest.  </li>
<li>Successfully picking the lock, you found valuable treasures, including coins, jewelry, and an ominous tome bound in human skin.  </li>
<li>Understanding the dark nature of the book, you decided to take it with you for proper disposal.  </li>
<li><strong>Return to the Dragon Shrine:</strong>  </li>
<li>With your mission in the Oldwoods complete, you escorted the rescued teenagers, including <strong>Corinna</strong> and <strong>Sostrate</strong>, back to Estoria.  </li>
<li>At the <strong>Dragon Shrine</strong>, you returned the Horn of Balmytria to <strong>Aesop</strong>, the shrine's keeper.  </li>
<li>Each of you participated in the sacred ritual of drinking from the horn, as required by your quest.  </li>
<li>Upon drinking, you all experienced vivid dreams of standing aboard a ghostly ship, the legendary <strong>Ultros</strong>, holding a mysterious bronze device resembling a compass.  </li>
<li><strong>Interpreting the Visions:</strong>  </li>
<li>Aesop helped interpret your dreams, explaining that the Ultros is a cursed ship captained by the infamous Dragonlord <strong>Estor Arkelander</strong>.  </li>
<li>The bronze device you saw is likely the <strong>Antikythera</strong>, a magical compass said to navigate any sea, including the mystical Forgotten Sea.  </li>
<li>These visions hinted at future challenges and the importance of seeking out the Ultros and the Antikythera.  </li>
<li><strong>Addressing the Cursed Necklace:</strong>  </li>
<li>Aesop informed <strong>Delphi</strong> that to lift the <strong>curse of the graverobber</strong>, the emerald necklace he carried must be returned to its rightful place in the <strong>Necropolis at Telamok</strong>.  </li>
<li>Understanding the urgency, you agreed to undertake this task to free Delphi from the curse.  </li>
<li><strong>Disposing of the Evil Tome:</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>Astreus</strong> presented the sinister book found in Demetria's chambers to Aesop.  </li>
<li>Grateful for removing such a dangerous artifact from circulation, Aesop safely disposed of it.  </li>
<li>As a token of appreciation, he gifted Astreus a <strong>potion of heroism</strong>.  </li>
<li><strong>Parley with the Centaurs:</strong>  </li>
<li>Seeking a resolution to the looming threat against Estoria, you approached the centaur encampment under a flag of truce.  </li>
<li>You met <strong>Baenor</strong>, the centaur chieftain, who was leading the forces gathered north of the city.  </li>
<li>Baenor challenged you to single combat, offering a chance to deter the centaur assault if you proved victorious.  </li>
<li>He also proposed that you could offer yourselves as sacrifices to <strong>Sydon</strong> in place of <strong>Princess Anora</strong>.  </li>
<li>After deliberation, you declined both offers, recognizing the risks outweighed the potential benefits.  </li>
<li><strong>Journey to the Necropolis at Telamok:</strong>  </li>
<li>Deciding to pursue your next Great Labor, you set out for the Necropolis, a sacred burial site of the ancient Dragonlords.  </li>
<li>The journey took approximately six hours, leading you into the icy reaches of the <strong>Mithral Mountains</strong>.  </li>
<li>As you ascended the <strong>Path of the Dead</strong>, you prepared for dangers by plugging your ears with wax to guard against creatures that use enchanting songs.  </li>
<li><strong>Encounter with the Harpies:</strong>  </li>
<li>Along the narrow mountain path, you were ambushed by three harpies whose alluring songs could lure travelers to their doom.  </li>
<li>Thanks to your precautions, you resisted their enchantments and engaged them in combat.  </li>
<li>You successfully defeated the harpies, sending their bodies plummeting into the mist-filled chasms below.  </li>
<li><strong>Meeting the Silent Guardian:</strong>  </li>
<li>At the entrance of the Necropolis, a silent, skeletal guardian barred your passage.  </li>
<li>He extended a bony hand, demanding a <strong>burnished coin of the Dragonlords</strong> as payment to enter.  </li>
<li>Respecting the sacred traditions, you offered the coin, and he stepped aside, granting you entry.  </li>
<li>The guardian warned you that disturbing the tombs could invoke curses upon you.  </li>
<li><strong>Lifting Delphi's Curse:</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>Delphi</strong> presented the cursed necklace to the guardian.  </li>
<li>The skeletal figure accepted it, returning it to its rightful place within the Necropolis.  </li>
<li>As a result, the curse afflicting Delphi was lifted, freeing him from its adverse effects.  </li>
<li><strong>Exploration of the Necropolis:</strong>  </li>
<li>You carefully navigated the ancient tombs, taking care not to disturb the resting places of the honored dead.  </li>
<li>The Necropolis was vast and solemn, each tomb a monument to the heroes of old.  </li>
<li><strong>Delphi</strong> felt a profound connection to this place, seeking clues about his destiny as the <strong>Vanished One</strong>.  </li>
<li><strong>Raina</strong>, remembering her path as the <strong>Haunted One</strong>, realized that interrogating Demetria might reveal vital information about her past and the mysteries that haunt her.</li>
