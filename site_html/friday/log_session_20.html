<li>Pythor our adventure on the high seas and will meat us in Mytros in two days  </li>
<li>He looked in the treasury for some Mithral for us to melt down for the Keledone, but he did not have any  </li>
<li>He gave delphi some half plate armor  </li>
<li>We took the boat down the river for half a day and then walked overland to the sour vintage inn  </li>
<li>We when we got there we were greeted as heroes and offered free food and lodging  </li>
<li>We got some rumors from different people  </li>
<li>And we met a lady who was lady who was a merchant and we were able to secure enough mitral items to make a ingot of mithral  </li>
<li>We spent the night at the inn for free and got a long rest  </li>
<li>The next day we hiked to the dead falls   </li>
<li>We braved the violent rapids and narrowly escaped getting crushed inside of the gates of death wich almost crushed the party  </li>
<li>We searched high and low for a way into the falls which appeared to drop into nothingness  </li>
<li>But eventually we made our survival rolls and found the pathway down the side of the cliff and discovered  </li>
<li>Then we found the secret inlet  </li>
<li>There we found an old but well maintained warship  </li>
<li>Some of the PCs had to levitate across the water and we boarded the vessel  </li>
<li>Rheana used her divine sense and felt the presence of many ghosts in the ship  </li>
<li>Somebody touched the mast and had horrifying vision of the dryad being killed to make the mast  </li>
<li>We saw all the ghosts appear all over  </li>
<li>The original ship captain estor arkelanded was at the helm  </li>
<li>We approached him and learned:  </li>
<li>He made us a deal to captain, but he has to stick around and give "guidance"  </li>
<li>He wants to take over the land and get rid of the natives  </li>
<li>He told us to find his treacherous thanes and get rid of them by searching the ship  </li>
<li>He made a deal Lutheria to give him eternal life (or something like that) - cannot be killed by anothers blade</li>
</ul>
