<p>Log</p>
<h2 id="the-temple's-hidden-depths"><strong>The Temple's Hidden Depths</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Your invisibility held as you descended below the Temple of Lutheria, where rows of wine casks concealed a more sinister trade  </li>
<li>In these depths, you met Lyra the Vigilant, one of the temple's trusted guardians  </li>
<li>The silence spell that perpetually shrouded these chambers muffled your fight  </li>
<li>When Lyra fell, her black sword - a badge of her authority - became yours</li>
</ul>
<p>## <strong>The Prison Below</strong> {#the-prison-below}</p>
<ul>
<li>Behind the reinforced door lay the truth of the temple's wine merchant facade  </li>
<li>Children from Stygian Row filled iron cages - chosen because their families lacked the influence to seek justice  </li>
<li>These were meant to be the cult's newest initiates, destined for dark ceremonies under the full moon  </li>
<li>Lyra's desk held letters revealing the temple's true purpose - human sacrifice masked by wine festivals</li>
</ul>
<p>## <strong>The Serpent's Power</strong> {#the-serpent's-power}</p>
<ul>
<li>From the opened sewer grate emerged an ancient horror - a serpentine creature of bone and malevolent magic  </li>
<li>Its power turned Astreus against the party, proving why the temple chose these tunnels for their dark work  </li>
<li>The creature's influence spread through your group like poison before retreating into the vast sewer network beneath Mytros  </li>
<li>Even after breaking free, you felt the lingering touch of its evil</li>
</ul>
<p>## <strong>The Dark Ceremony</strong> {#the-dark-ceremony}</p>
<ul>
<li>Beyond the prison, you witnessed High Priestess Septia herself leading a ritual  </li>
<li>A victim lay bound upon the stone bier while cultists chanted in eerie silence  </li>
<li>This was one of the monthly ceremonies that kept the temple's true masters in power  </li>
<li>The chamber held dark treasures, including a mysterious floating tome that caught Delphi's eye</li>
</ul>
<p>## <strong>Queen Vallus's Justice</strong> {#queen-vallus's-justice}</p>
<ul>
<li>The Queen of Mytros, herself a goddess of wisdom, recognized the evidence of corruption you brought before her  </li>
<li>Each rescued child's story confirmed what she had long suspected about the wine merchant family  </li>
<li>She mobilized her forces against the temple, specifically the amazon warrior Makhaira and her squad  </li>
<li>Your reward was an elegant Handbag of Holding - later traded to secure the dark tome from the raid</li>
</ul>
<p>## <strong>Flight to the Forge</strong> {#flight-to-the-forge}</p>
<ul>
<li>Captain Sammy, a dwarf whose reputation on the river is unmatched, agreed to brave the dangerous rapids  </li>
<li>Through the night, your magic aided her navigation of the treacherous waters of the Arkelon  </li>
<li>Her ship, "The Mariner," proved worthy of its captain's confidence  </li>
<li>By dawn, you'd reached the hidden entrance to the Mithral Forge</li>
</ul>
<p>## <strong>At the Forge</strong> {#at-the-forge}</p>
<ul>
<li>Nyssi triggered the mechanism that parts the great falls, revealing the secret dock  </li>
<li>Volkan and Pyrah had completed your commissions:  </li>
<li>Plate armor worthy of a hero  </li>
<li>Chakrams forged from pure mithral  </li>
<li>Then Volkan revealed his discovery - an ancient Keledone, one of the legendary mechanical servants  </li>
<li>To restore this marvel would require both mithral and gold in significant quantities</li>
</ul>
