<h3 id="a-troubled-voyage-lutherias-nightmare"><strong>A Troubled Voyage: Lutheria's Nightmare</strong></h3>
<p>As the <em>Ultros</em> sailed toward the island marked by the Constellation of the Centaur, the party was assailed by a shared, horrifying dream sent by the Titan, Lutheria. The vision depicted shipwrecked sailors succumbing to cannibalism on a desolate shore. The dream's potent magic overwhelmed both Astraeus and Delphi, who awoke consumed by a violent bloodlust, turning on their companions.</p>
<p>A chaotic struggle ensued below decks.
*   Aella and Rhaena, having resisted the dream's influence, fought to restrain their friends without causing serious harm.
*   Aella managed to grapple the frenzied Astraeus, while Rhaena attempted to subdue him with nets.
*   The conflict was resolved when Rhaena, having attuned to the recently acquired <strong>Titan's Bane</strong>, struck her companions with the flat of the adamantine blade. The sword's inherent <em>dispel magic</em> property successfully broke Lutheria's enchantment, first on Astraeus and then on Delphi, returning them to their senses.
*   In the aftermath, Delphi noted that he should consider attuning to the <strong>Codex of Nocturnal Mysteries</strong> before sleeping to gain its advantage on dream-related checks and prevent future mental assaults.</p>
<h3 id="arrival-at-scorpion-island"><strong>Arrival at Scorpion Island</strong></h3>
<p>After three days at sea, the party arrived at a flat, arid island dominated by a single, ominous black tower at its center. An impressive History check from Astraeus confirmed this was <strong>Scorpion Island</strong>, a known proving ground for Aresian warriors due to its dangerous fauna.</p>
<p>The party moored the <em>Ultros</em> and took a rowboat to a shore marked by crumbling fortifications and beautiful, flowering trees. There, they encountered the very same Aresian warrior monks they had met on Turtle Island, led by Captain Galenus.</p>
<h3 id="counsel-with-the-monks-of-aresia"><strong>Counsel with the Monks of Aresia</strong></h3>
<p>Galenus and his lieutenants confirmed the island's dark history:
*   The island's centaur tribe was cursed long ago by a powerful gynosphinx known as the <strong>Lotus Witch</strong>, who resides in the central tower.
*   The centaurs had destroyed a "living library" of knowledge carved into the island's trees, and as punishment, the witch cursed them to transform into monstrous giant scorpions upon reaching adulthood.
*   The Aresian monks use the island as a sacred trial ground, fighting the transformed centaurs to test their initiates and grant the cursed creatures a final peace.</p>
<p>The monks warned the party to avoid the Lotus Witch's tower, shared a simple meal with them, and asked them to check on their initiates, who were currently undergoing their trial inland. The party also confirmed their goal of acquiring a giant scorpion stinger and tail for the marid, Shazum.</p>
<h3 id="trial-by-fire-the-scorpions-oasis"><strong>Trial by Fire: The Scorpion's Oasis</strong></h3>
<p>Following the path inland, the party was drawn by the sounds of battle to an ancient, scorpion-themed temple near an oasis. They discovered the Aresian initiates locked in a desperate fight against three <strong>giant scorpions</strong>, and they were losing badly.</p>
<p>The party charged into battle to aid the young warriors.
*   Aella used the silent path of her <strong>Oathkeeper Chakram</strong> to strike all three scorpions in a single devastating attack.
*   The combined might of the party and the remaining monks quickly dispatched two of the scorpions.
*   The largest of the creatures, a <strong>Gargantuan Scorpion</strong>, proved more resilient, grappling and killing one of the initiates before the party could intervene.
*   As the battle raged, the ground began to vibrate, heralding a new threat.</p>
<h3 id="session-end-next-steps"><strong>Session End &amp; Next Steps</strong></h3>
<p>The session ended on a cliffhanger. As the party fought the Gargantuan Scorpion, a new, even more terrifying creature crested a nearby sand dune: a colossal <strong>Scorpion Matriarch</strong>, covered in swarming baby scorpions, joining the fray to defend her brood.</p>
<p>The party will begin the next session in the middle of this dangerous encounter. Once the island's business is concluded, they have discussed traveling to the <strong>Isle of the Fates</strong>, guided by the Constellation of the Bard, to pursue Astraeus's epic path.</p>
