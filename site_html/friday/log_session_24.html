<li>Reconfirmed the goal to retrieve brass dragon eggs potentially hidden within the Firewalker fortress in the volcano.  </li>

<strong>Stealth &amp; Combat:</strong>  </li>
<li>Successfully used Delphi's basilisk shield and coordinated attacks to silently eliminate two Firewalker guards patrolling a bridge.  </li>
<li>Infiltrated a nearby sleeping chamber, eliminating two more guards using similar tactics (basilisk shield + attacks).  </li>
<li>Looted a trapped chest within the sleeping chamber (Aella disarmed trap &amp; picked lock).<br />
<strong>Reconnaissance:</strong>  </li>
