<ul>
<li><strong>Breaching the Barrier:</strong> After discussing the dangers of the time-distorting field around the tower, the party decided to send one person in first to test it. [cite: 130, 131]</li>
<li><strong>Delphi's Gamble:</strong> Delphi volunteered to enter the field. [cite: 132] He cast <em>Bless</em> on himself, Aella, and Astraeus, and tied a rope around his waist for the party to hold. [cite: 133, 135, 136] Astraeus also granted him Bardic Inspiration. [cite: 137, 139]</li>
<li><strong>A World Unmoored:</strong> Upon stepping into the field, Delphi witnessed time become unmoored, with the sun and stars wheeling madly across the sky from the wrong horizons. [cite: 144, 145] A door became visible in the side of the once-seamless tower. [cite: 147] To the rest of the party, Delphi appeared to be in a state of superposition before vanishing entirely. [cite: 148, 159, 160]</li>
<li><strong>Reunification:</strong> After briefly exiting the field to find his companions gone, Delphi re-entered. [cite: 161, 166, 175] Aella and Astraeus, seeing him at the tower door, followed him into the temporal field and the party was reunited. [cite: 186, 188, 191, 194]</li>
<li><strong>The Lost Children:</strong> The party entered the tower, finding a large chamber inhabited by dozens of children of various races. [cite: 200, 202, 203] These children were revealed to be former adventurers, de-aged by the Lotus Witch. [cite: 206, 208, 244, 254, 255]</li>
<li><strong>A Warning Given:</strong> A young boy named Leander and other children warned the party that they should not have come and urged them to visit the "flower lady" at the top of the tower immediately to show proper respect. [cite: 233, 235, 242, 247] They advised the party to be honest and knowledgeable about Thylea's history, as the witch asks questions about the old times. [cite: 250, 251, 252]</li>
<li><strong>The Tower's Secrets:</strong> The party ascended the long, spiraling staircase, passing through several chambers:<ul>
<li>A museum containing preserved specimens, most notably the skeletal remains of a six-armed Gigan in ancient bronze armor. [cite: 301, 317, 318, 319]</li>
<li>A portal chamber dominated by a massive, intricate summoning circle and braziers burning with magical flames. [cite: 331, 332, 341]</li>
<li>A room with multiple windows looking out into other planes of existence, including a hellscape, a heavenly plane, the Astral Plane, and a strange twilight world with a crystalline city. [cite: 351, 355, 357, 358, 359, 367, 368] One window, sealed with glass, looked down upon Scorpion Island from miles above. [cite: 360, 361, 363]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Sphinx's Lair:</strong> At the summit, the party entered a vast chamber and came face-to-face with the Lotus Witch, a majestic gynosphinx. [cite: 382, 388]</li>
<li><strong>A Test of Knowledge:</strong> Intrigued by the party's quest and the presence of a Dragonlord (Delphi), the Sphinx agreed to share her knowledge if they could first prove their wisdom. [cite: 398, 409] They must correctly answer three of her four questions about the history of Thylea. [cite: 414, 415] Failure means joining the "nursery" of children below. [cite: 416]</li>
<li><strong>Question 1 - The Cruelest Lord:</strong> The Sphinx asked, "Who was the cruelest of the Dragonlords?" [cite: 493]<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> The party correctly identified <strong>Estor Arkelander</strong>. [cite: 494, 510] The Sphinx confirmed this was correct. [cite: 511]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 2 - The First Lord:</strong> The Sphinx asked, "Who was the first of the Dragonlords?" [cite: 511]<ul>
<li><strong>Answer:</strong> After deliberation, the party correctly identified <strong>Xander</strong>. [cite: 625, 626] The Sphinx confirmed this was also correct, adding that she knew him personally. [cite: 631, 632]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Question 3 - The Twin Titans:</strong> The Sphinx asked, "When Thylea bore fruit, which two Titans sprang forth from a single pit?" [cite: 635]<ul>
<li><strong>Status:</strong> The party debated the answer, with different members suspecting different pairs of Titans. The session concluded before a final answer was given to the Sphinx. [cite: 636, 655, 657, 672]</li>
