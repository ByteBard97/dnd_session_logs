<h1 id="session-32">Session 32</h1>
<p><strong>Session Summary: Post-Themis &amp; Return to Turtle Island</strong></p>
<p>The session began following the heroes' victory on Themis, where they defeated Queen Thesilea and liberated the Amazon temple.</p>
<p><strong>Themis Aftermath &amp; Departures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bront &amp; Steros:</strong> The famed Jancan blacksmith Bront was successfully rescued from the temple and reunited with his son Steros aboard the <em>Ultros</em>. They are now available to craft non-magical items for the party.  </li>
<li><strong>Amazon Sisterhood:</strong> Darien (Aella's cousin and rightful heir) and Makaira (the queen's attendant) remained on Themis to reorganize the Sisterhood, root out Lutheria's cult, and prepare for Aella's potential return as queen.  </li>
<li><strong>Aella's Epic Path:</strong> Aella must still slay the Great Roc of the Forgotten Sea and present its head to the Sisterhood to prove her divine right to rule and reclaim her throne.  </li>
<li><strong>Party Level Up:</strong> All party members gained a level for their heroic deeds.  </li>
<li><strong>Astraeus's Character Sheet:</strong> Astraeus confirmed changes to his character, accepting the level 8 update with a Constitution increase and a Charisma of 21. He chose<br />
<em>Polymorph</em> and <em>Dimension Door</em> as his two fourth-level spells, noting that <em>Dimension Door</em> would allow him to bring one other person with him.  </li>
<li><strong>New Items:</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>Rhaena:</strong> Attuned to the <em>hovering chariot</em> heirloom, which provides significant buffs, including increased movement, advantage on initiative, extra force damage on charges, and benefits for a passenger (like disadvantage on attacks against them or advantage on concentration checks).  </li>
<li><strong>Aella:</strong> Wields the <em>Oathkeeper Chakram</em>, a "deadly returning disc capable of unleashing a silent, vorpal path of destruction". She also plans to wear the<br />
<em>Winged Sandals of the Harpy Queen</em>.  </li>
<li><strong>Titan's Bane (Blade of Talius):</strong> The party successfully retrieved the legendary sword <em>Titan's Bane</em> from the hydra's stomach. It is a +3 adamantine sword that deals +1d6 necrotic damage, an additional +3d6 necrotic damage against Titans and cyclopes, and casts<br />
<em>dispel magic</em> when it hits a creature. It can change between a longsword, shortsword, or greatsword. Its adamantine nature allows it to deal double damage against objects and constructs, and it has advantage on saving throws against attempts to damage it. The sword has a subtle presence, like a voice in the wielder's mind. Rhaena cannot attune to it immediately due to other attuned items but noted the short rest attunement time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Hydra Encounter:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The party sought the legendary sword from the temple's hydra.  </li>
<li>Astraeus used<br />
<em>Polymorph</em> to turn the 10-headed hydra into a giant toad, with the DM ruling that if the creature is killed while polymorphed, it reverts to its original form.  </li>
<li>Aella attempted to retrieve the sword from the polymorphed toad's gullet, finally succeeding on her second attempt.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Travel to Turtle Island:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The party decided to stop at Turtle Island on their way to the next destination to deliver the basilisk eye to Shazum.  </li>
<li>Astraeus's attempt to use his harp to speed up travel failed, so the journey to Turtle Island (and then the Centaur constellation island) would take the full 3 days.  </li>
<li>Upon arrival, they noted a new Mytrosian Royal Academy caravel, the<br />
<em>Sage's Voyage</em>, docked there.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Turtle Island (Jazirat Zulhaf) Interactions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shazum:</strong>  </li>
<li>Confirmed receipt of the Perfect Basilisk Eye, completing that quest.  </li>
<li>Reiterated the previous reward options: 750 gp, a<br />
<em>bag of holding</em>, <em>cloak of protection</em>, <em>periapt of wound closure</em>, <em>Orb of Star Metal</em>, <em>Mithril Ingot</em>, <em>Vial of Gorgon Blood</em>, or <em>Dragon Scales</em>. The party clarified they had already received the<br />
<em>Orb of Star Metal</em>.  </li>
<li>Gave a new quest: acquire an<br />
<em>intact scorpion stinger and tail</em> from a giant scorpion.  </li>
<li>Rolled for new items in stock:<br />
<em>Ring of Water Walking</em>, <em>Gloves of Dexterity</em>, and <em>Gauntlets of Hill Giant Strength</em>.  </li>
<li>Rolled for new ingredients:<br />
<em>Elemental Mote</em>, <em>Golemstone</em>, and <em>Hydra Scales</em>. The party chose the<br />
<em>Golemstone</em> as a reward.  </li>
<li>Had<br />
<em>Potions of Growth</em> (1d3), <em>Potion of Fire Giant Strength</em>, <em>Potion of Frost Giant Strength</em>, and <em>Oil of Sharpness</em> in stock for purchase.  </li>
<li><strong>Unknown Potions:</strong> He identified the mysterious red and blue potions from Themis as a type of enlarge/reduce potion with an additional, subtle side effect that he couldn't pinpoint, suggesting multiple doses might increase the effect.  </li>
<li><strong>Shimmering Pink Liquid:</strong> He identified this as a <em>Potion of Chromatic Displacement</em>, allowing the user to become translucent, phase through solid objects for 10 feet of movement per turn (must end in unoccupied space), gain resistance to all damage except force and psychic, but lose phasing and gain disadvantage on stealth in bright light.  </li>
<li><strong>The Floating Lantern (Tavern):</strong>  </li>
<li>Run by Lyra Padma, a half-elf proprietor.  </li>
<li>Ordered a "Harpy Screech" (Astraeus) and a "Chaos Cocktail" (Delphi).  </li>
<li><em>Harpy Screech</em> effect: Once per hour, action to shriek (15 ft radius, DC 13 Con save or deafened for 1 min); user becomes hoarse with disadvantage on Charisma checks for 1 hour.  </li>
<li><em>Chaos Cocktail</em> effect: Roll a d6; Delphi rolled 5, causing him to "hiccup small harmless illusions for one hour".  </li>
<li><strong>Elara Vancroft:</strong>  </li>
<li>The party encountered Elara Vancroft, a researcher in "Astro-Geological History" from the Mytrosian Royal Academy, intensely studying maps and instruments in the tavern.  </li>
<li>She was initially annoyed by the interruption but became interested when the party identified themselves as adventurers with firsthand experience.  </li>
<li>She proposed trading information: their firsthand accounts for her research.  </li>
<li>The party confirmed Fire Island is the Constellation of the Prisoner (though she was unaware they destroyed a colony).  </li>
<li>Elara stated the Constellation of the Centaur leads to<br />
<em>Scorpion Island</em> or <em>Indigo Island</em>.  </li>
<li>The party shared an Amazonian map, which she found fascinating and copied.  </li>
<li>Elara believes the Constellation of the Bard leads to the<br />
<em>Isle of the Fates</em>.  </li>
<li>She confirmed the Constellation of the Gygan leads to the<br />
<em>Island of Yonder</em> (Sydon's general Gaius's stronghold, where the missing Antikythera gear and Delphi's family armor are located).  </li>
<li>The party confirmed Themis is the Constellation of the Twins.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Future Crafting:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The party inquired about enchanting a Mithril Chain Shirt into +1 armor, which requires the Mithril Forge and ingredients like two Mithril Ingots and a Golemstone or Hydra Scales. They considered sending their flying construct, Caledony, with materials to the Mithril Forge. They will send the Golemstone they just received for this purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next Destination:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The party is now sailing from Turtle Island to the island marked by the Constellation of the Centaur (either Scorpion Island or Indigo Island).</li>
</ul>
<p>This session saw the successful conclusion of the Themis temple arc, the acquisition of powerful new magical items, a significant level-up, and key information gained about future destinations and their associated constellations. The path to reclaiming Aella's throne and facing the Titans is becoming clearer.</p>
