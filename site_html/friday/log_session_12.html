<li><strong>Astreus:</strong> Seek out the Wisdom of Queen Vallus in Mytros to further your quest for knowledge  </li>
<li><strong>Delphi:</strong> Xander gave you your crown and his mystic armaments. Your fabled armor has been stolen by Gaius, the commander of the Order of Sydon. He keeps your armor in his fortress on the Island of Yonder, which is heavily fortified.  </li>
<li><strong>Rhaena:</strong> Demetria needs to be interrogated to find out the connection to your family; She is in the Dungeon in Estoria  </li>
<li>Estoria is under siege by a formidable centaur army demanding the sacrifice of Princess Anora to appease the Titan Sydon. As the Oracle's Chosen, you must find a way to save both the city and the princess before the next full moon. Options include challenging the centaur chieftain to single combat to deter the invading forces or negotiating with the Order of Sydon to accept an alternative to the princess's sacrifice. You might also consider offering yourselves in her place.  </li>
<li>Recover Pythor's Hammer from King Pythor and then Volkan can use it to repair your damaged items</li>
</ul>
<p>Log<br />
<strong>The Basilisk Cavern</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deep within the rocky gorge, you descended into the lair of the deadly basilisks. These monstrous creatures, harbingers of petrification, had claimed the lives and freedom of many—including a group of ill-fated bandits now frozen in stone.  </li>
<li><strong>The Battle:</strong> You fought valiantly against these creatures, narrowly avoiding their petrifying gazes. Each strike of your weapons reverberated through the cavern, and though the battle was fierce, your resolve never wavered.  </li>
<li><strong>The Spoils of War:</strong> You harvested precious basilisk ichor, a key alchemical component. Some will be used to craft a salve to cure petrification—others, perhaps, for darker purposes. From the corpse of a basilisk, you claimed its fearsome head, destined to enhance a magical shield under the skilled hands of Volkan, the God of the Forge.  </li>
<li><strong>A Choice Left Behind:</strong> Despite recovering the salve, you chose not to release the petrified bandits—a somber reminder of the cost of greed and violence in the wilds of Thylea.  </li>
<li><strong>The Hidden Treasure:</strong> In the shadowy depths of the cavern, you uncovered a trapped chest filled with modest loot, adding a small glimmer of triumph to the grim surroundings.<br />
<strong>The Centaur Encampment</strong>  </li>
<li>On your journey back to Estoria, the sound of drums and hooves led you to the centaur encampment, where the air crackled with tension and ancient grievances.  </li>
<li><strong>Baenor's Words:</strong> Meeting with Baenor, the chieftain of the centaurs, you explained your plan to take Princess Anora's place as a sacrifice to Sydon. Baenor's sarcasm was biting as he wished you "good luck," urging you to deal with Gaius and pray to your gods and ancestors—for your souls were already in peril.<br />
<strong>Negotiating with Gaius</strong>  </li>
<li>Back in King Pythor's palace, you stood before the heavily-armored Gaius, commander of the Order of Sydon. With determination and Astreus's silver tongue, you convinced him to accept your self-sacrifice in place of Anora.  </li>
<li><strong>The Bargain Struck:</strong> Gaius reveled in the deal, mocking your bravery as four heroes offered themselves in exchange for what he considered a "useless princess." However, you cunningly persuaded him to move the sacrifice to the following night, saving precious time for your preparations.<br />
<strong>A Royal Thanks</strong>  </li>
<li>King Pythor, overcome with gratitude, summoned Princess Anora. She tearfully thanked you for your noble choice, gifting you a <strong>magical pendant</strong> to bring you luck as you face the horrors of the Rock of Estor.  </li>
<li><strong>The King's Hammer:</strong> Pythor promised his magical hammer as your reward if you survive. This weapon, forged by Volkan and steeped in divine power, is a treasure of legend and a beacon of hope for Estoria.  </li>
<li><strong>Anora's Warning:</strong> She urged you to leave your equipment with her to avoid it being pilfered by Sydon's acolytes during the ritual.<br />
<strong>Demetria's Prison</strong>  </li>
<li>In the depths of Pythor's dungeon, you confronted Demetria, the vengeful dryad who once twisted innocent souls into monstrous maenads in her service to Lutheria.  </li>
<li><strong>The Heirloom's Secret:</strong> Rheana demanded the return of her family ring, a precious artifact connected to her forgotten lineage and prophecy. Demetria, bitter and defiant, refused at first but relented after being put to sleep and swearing an oath to the party.  </li>
<li><strong>The Oath Fulfilled:</strong> Bound by her words, Demetria produced the ring like a magician, conjuring it from thin air. She revealed that the Ritual Tome—her dark grimoire of transformation—had been a gift from her mistress, Lutheria.  </li>
<li><strong>Freedom Granted:</strong> Though wary, you honored her oath, releasing her from captivity. With haughty arrogance, Demetria departed the palace, her connection to Lutheria an ominous thread still tied to your fates.<br />
<strong>A Declaration to Estoria</strong>  </li>
<li>Delphi, ever the voice of the people, announced your intention to stand in Anora's stead to the bustling agora. A crowd gathered, whispering of your courage and folly in equal measure. Delphi assured them that the gods themselves would protect you, turning the sacrifice into a spectacle for all to witness.<br />
<strong>Evening Preparations</strong>  </li>
<li>As night fell, you each took to your tasks:  </li>
<li><strong>Astreus's Performance:</strong> At the Dragon's Tooth Inn, Astreus captivated the crowd with music, his lute case overflowing with coins by the end of the night.  </li>
<li><strong>Aella's Watchful Eye:</strong> Aella's mechanical bird soared back to the basilisk cave, ensuring no further dangers stirred within its depths.  </li>
<li><strong>Delphi's Vigil:</strong> Delphi shadowed Gaius through the darkened streets of Estoria, uncovering the location of an unassuming house frequented by acolytes of Sydon.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lutheria's Wrath</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the dead of night, the shadow of Lutheria descended upon your dreams. Each of you was plagued by visions of terror and madness:  </li>
<li><strong>Rheana's Torment:</strong> Hallucinations of Lutheria's scorn haunted Rheana, her reflection twisted in the mirror and the night sky. Drawing upon her paladin's grace, she calmed her mind and banished the horrors.  </li>
<li><strong>Aella's Silence:</strong> Stricken by an unnatural dumbness, Aella's voice was stolen, leaving her unable to speak. Despite your efforts, the curse lingers, a cruel reminder of Lutheria's power.  </li>
<li><strong>A Frightened Resolve:</strong> As dawn approaches, you wake shaken but determined. The stakes have never been higher, and Lutheria has made her disdain for you clear.</li>
</ul>
