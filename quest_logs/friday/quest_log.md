**Quest Log:**

# Session 1 {#session-1}

* 1\. The Summons at The Sour Vintage Inn  
  * Keerah's Summons: We were summoned to The Sour Vintage Inn, located twenty miles east of Estoria. Keerah, a renowned poet, revealed herself to be an agent of the Oracle. She informed us of our great destiny and tasked us with hunting a corrupted giant boar, unleashed by the Titans, Sydon and Lutheria, to terrorize the Heartlands.  
  * The Task: Keerah explained that the boar was a symbol of the weakening Oath of Peace, which once protected the mortals of Thylea from the wrath of the Titans. This boar had already slain many, and Keerah urged us to prove ourselves as the heroes of prophecy by slaying the beast.  
* 2\. The Hunt for the Corrupted Boar  
  * Journey into the Heartlands: We set off at dawn, guided by two scouts, Taneias and Javon. The morning was cold and foggy as we ventured northward, passing ravaged farms and gouged trees—grim signs of the boar's rampage.  
  * The Battle: We tracked the boar to its lair, a cave strewn with the remains of its victims. The beast ambushed us, and in the ensuing battle, one of our scouts, Taneias, was tragically slain.   
  * Aella launched her mighty chakram at the beast, slitting its throat and laying it low. We emerged victorious, slaying the corrupted boar.  
  * The Boar's Prophecy: Before it died, the boar spoke to us in our minds, warning of an ancient power that sleeps in Thylea and prophesying doom and darkness for all mortal things. It claimed that no prophecy would save us from this fate.  
* 3\. The Sacrifice and Return to The Sour Vintage  
  * Honoring Pythor: Following Aella's advice, we burned the remains of the boar as a sacrificial offering to Pythor, the god of battle. In doing so, we hoped to honor him and gain his favor in the battles to come.   
  * Aella intuits the favor of Pythor, god of Battle.  
  * We recover some treasure and a magical silver spear, which is held by Rheana.  
  * Return to The Sour Vintage: We returned to The Sour Vintage Inn as heroes. The townsfolk greeted us with cheers and gratitude for freeing them from the terror of the boar. We spent the evening resting and reflecting on the day's events.  
  * Astreaus played an amazing performance regaling the audience with tales and song of our mighty deeds. He made a lot of gold in the process.  
* Level up to 2  
* 4\. The Oracle's Prophecy  
  * The Next Step: The following day, Kyrah reminded us of the importance of visiting the Oracle at her temple to the east. She believes that the Oracle, Versi, will reveal the next steps in our journey and provide us with guidance on how to avert the coming catastrophe.  
  * Journey to the Temple: We set off through the wilderness, leaving behind the comfort of The Sour Vintage and traveling through the Heartlands toward the temple. The journey took us nearly a day, and we arrived at the temple, ready to learn what the Oracle has foreseen.  
* 5\. Entering the Temple  
  * Aella was burned by the steam as she lunged forth through the geysers  
  * There are dangerous looking soldiers up ahead who wear the garb of Sydon

# Session 2 {#session-2}

  **Approach the Temple of the Oracle:**

* Upon arriving at the temple, notice the presence of soldiers at the entrance. Decide on the best way to approach them—whether through conversation, stealth, or another tactic.

* Engage with the soldiers to learn why they are stationed at the temple. Use diplomacy, intimidation, or subterfuge to uncover more about their purpose and intentions.

  **Meet with the Oracle:**

* As you delve deeper into the temple, your goal is to find the Oracle, Versi, and receive her prophecy. Be prepared for any challenges or unexpected encounters along the way.

  **Plan Your Next Steps:**

* After meeting with the Oracle and learning about your next objectives, discuss as a party which of the Great Labors you will pursue first. Consider whether to swear the Oath of Fellowship to solidify your unity.  
* We start in the Cavern next to the Temple guarded by what appear to be soldiers of Sydon  
* The party attacks the soldiers guarding the temple  
* One soldier ran inside the temple to warn his comrades.  
* More Soldiers came out of the temple and attacked the party\!

* They warned us that the Oracle below has been captured by a crone of powerful magical means  
* The party convinced Proteus the temple attendant to hand over 4 healing potions to the party  
* We readied ourselves to go further into the temple and free the Oracle

# Session 3 {#session-3}

* **After defeating Braeca and his soldiers in the upper chamber of the temple, the heroes secured the area and ensured no immediate threats remained.**  
* **They spoke with Proteus, the elder temple attendant, who informed them about the sea hag Heleka and her capture of the Oracle, Versi.**  
* **The heroes decided to explore the temple further to find a way to rescue Versi from the basement levels.**  
* **They discovered a locked stairway door leading to the temple basement and searched for the key to proceed.**  
* **In the Attendants' Chambers, they encountered four enchanted flying swords set as a trap by Heleka.**  
* **Instead of destroying the flying swords, the heroes cleverly locked them away, neutralizing the threat without further combat.**  
* **With the key obtained from the chambers, they unlocked the stairway door and descended into the basement.**  
* **At the bottom of the stairs, they were ambushed by a mimic disguised as a door, which they defeated after a brief skirmish.**  
* **Entering the Oracle's grotto, they navigated through the mist-filled cave, remaining cautious of potential dangers.**  
* **They identified and avoided a rug of smothering that was placed as another trap by Heleka.**  
* **Proceeding deeper, they encountered a water weird guarding the entrance to the Oracle's chamber.**  
* **Engaging in battle, the heroes defeated the water weird, clearing the path to Versi.**  
* **In the Oracle's chamber, they found Heleka tormenting Versi and witnessed the slain temple attendant who could not be saved.**  
* **A fierce battle ensued between the heroes and Heleka, culminating in the defeat of the sea hag.**  
* **With Heleka vanquished, the heroes freed Versi from her watery bonds and offered her comfort.**  
* **Versi thanked the heroes for their bravery and introduced herself, expressing sorrow over the loss of her attendant.**  
* **The Oracle delivered her prophecy, outlining the three Great Labors the heroes must undertake:**  
  * **Claim the weapons of the first Dragonlords.**  
  * **Light the fires of the Mithral Forge.**  
  * **Drink from the Horn of Balmytria.**  
* **Versi spoke privately with each hero, providing personal insights related to their individual epic paths.**  
* **The heroes discussed the prophecy and, with guidance from Kyrah, decided their next course of action.**  
* **Kyrah challenged Astreus to an epic poetry competition to see who could write the best poem about the heroes' journey**  
* **Before departing, they swore an Oath of Fellowship, uniting them in their quest to fulfill the prophecy and save Thylea.**  
* **They then made their way to the city of Estoria and observed an encampment of fierce looking centaurs outside the north gate who looked ready to make war on the city**  
* **We stayed at the Dragon's tooth inn and had good food and drink**  
* **Astreaus played music for the crowd and made some gold for the party**  
* **We spoke with the innkeeper, Delphion and he gave us some clues about what to do next**  
* **We heard that the cult of Sydon wants Pythor to sacrifice his daughter on the rock of Estor where should would be devoured by monsters**  
* **We know there is something going on with the Mithril Mines and God of the Forge, Volkan who has a forge in the city**  
* **We know that there is something to do in the Necropolis at Telemok**  
* **Delphi's prophecy: "**You must retake your famed armor and crown. Seek them out in the Necropolis at Telamok. Old friends wait for you there.

# Session 4 {#session-4}

Agenda

* Explore the city of Estoria and meet with the gods there  
* Find out more about your personal quests  
* Figure out how to deal with the army of Centaurs outside the gates  
* Search for clues about how to carry out the Great Labors given to you by the Oracle

Notes

* **Rumor from the Innkeeper:** Thericles who works in the vineyard, has a missing daughter.  
* **Volkan's Forge:** In the heart of the city, you visited Volkan's Hall. There, you encountered Volkan, a gruff dwarf blacksmith who revealed himself as the God of the Forge. He spoke of the ancient Mithral Mines, cursed by the Titan Lutheria, and asked you to cleanse them and rekindle the legendary Mithral Forge.  
* **The Mysterious Necklace:** While exploring the bustling agora, Delphi was approached by a ragged beggar offering a gleaming emerald necklace. Ignoring the wary glances of nearby merchants, Delphi purchased it. Upon placing it in his pack, he felt an overwhelming sensation of fullness, as if he'd feasted for days.  
* **Audience with King Pythor:** Summoned to the palace, you met King Pythor, the God of Battle. With heavy heart, he revealed that the Titan Sydon demanded the sacrifice of his daughter, Princess Anora, to prevent a catastrophic assault on Estoria by centaur and cyclops forces. Bound by the Oath of Peace, Pythor could not intervene and pleaded for your aid.  
* **Parley with Gaius:** Pythor introduced you to Gaius, the stern commander of the Order of Sydon. You engaged in tense negotiations, seeking a way to save Anora and avert the impending doom. Gaius remained unyielding, emphasizing the severity of defying a Titan's will.  
* **The Rock of Estor:** Determined to understand the gravity of the sacrifice, you visited the Rock of Estor on the Arkelon River. There, you witnessed a chilling ritual: a cow bound to the rock, petrified by basilisks emerging from the depths, then shattered and consumed. The ominous sight underscored the peril Anora faced.  
* **The Dragon Shrine's Plight:** Seeking to fulfill one of your Great Labors, you headed to the Dragon Shrine. Aesop, the shrine's keeper, delivered dire news—the sacred Horn of Balmytria had been stolen by mischievous goatlings. Without it, your quest to drink from the horn was in jeopardy.  
* **Trail into the Oldwoods:** Following a haphazard trail of spilled wine and tiny hoofprints, you ventured into the dense and shadowy Oldwoods south of the city. The forest grew darker and more foreboding as you pressed on.  
* **Rescuing Corinna:** Deep within the woods, a terrified Corinna burst into a clearing, pursued by a band of mocking goatlings. She begged for your help to save her and her friends from a grim fate at the hands of a mysterious woman named Demetria. You confronted the goatlings, who taunted you with vicious insults, but you stood your ground and defeated them.  
* **A New Ally and a Dire Mission:** With Corinna safe for the moment, she revealed that Demetria holds the Horn of Balmytria within the depths of the Oldwoods. Determined to save her friends and reclaim the horn, she urged you to continue deeper into the forest.  
*

* Can take the help action and then fly away before the attack happens (owl)???

Notes:  
**Continuing the Exploration of the Mossy Temple:**

* Determined to recover the **Horn of Balmytria** and thwart Demetria's sinister plans, you pressed deeper into the ancient temple.  
  **Encounter with Vine Blights and Gargoyles:**  
* In the temple's entrance hall, you faced **animated vine blights** and two imposing **gargoyles**.  
  * The gargoyles sprang to life when you didn't offer coins to the statues' outstretched bowls.  
* After a tough battle, you emerged victorious.  
* Took a **short rest** (your second of the day) to recover and tend to your wounds.  
  **Descending into the Depths:**  
* Ventured down a **dark stairwell** leading beneath the temple.  
* The air grew cooler and the walls echoed with distant, unsettling sounds.  
* You sensed that greater dangers awaited below.  
  **Rescuing Sostrate from the Goatlings:**  
* In a cavern illuminated by faint luminescent fungi, you found **Sostrate**, one of Corinna's missing friends.  
* He was being tormented by a group of malicious **goatlings**.  
* Engaged the goatlings in combat and successfully rescued Sostrate.  
* **Sostrate and Corinna** decided to help other enchanted teenagers in the **Cavern of Fungus** (T9), hoping to break Demetria's spell over them.  
  **Allied with Loreus the Satyr:**  
* **Loreus**, the smitten satyr enamored with **Aella**, continued to assist you.  
* Attempted to **charm the gygan**, Demetria's formidable guardian.  
* However, **Demetria countered by charming Loreus**, momentarily turning him against you.  
  **Stealth Approach to the Feasting Hall:**  
* Opted to **sneak down the hallway** directly to the feasting hall, bypassing other rooms to confront Demetria swiftly.  
* Moved carefully to avoid alerting any additional guards or creatures.  
  **Confrontation in the Feasting Hall:**  
* Entered the grand feasting chamber where **Demetria** was preparing a dark ritual.  
* Four human girls sat around a lavish table, about to partake in a meal of **tainted human flesh**, unaware of its true nature.  
* **Astreus** used his powers of persuasion to **convince the girls not to eat**, revealing the gruesome truth.  
  * His words broke through Demetria's enchantment, and the girls fled in horror.

  **Battle with Demetria and the Gygan:**

* Furious at the disruption of her ritual, Demetria shed her facade of hospitality.  
* Commanded her six-armed **gygan** ally to attack you.  
  * The gygan wielded multiple weapons, presenting a significant threat.  
* **Loreus**, under Demetria's charm, posed an additional challenge.  
* The battle was intense, testing your skills and teamwork.  
* The session concluded **immediately after the gygan's turn** in the initiative order, leaving the combat at a critical juncture.  
  **Current Situation and Cliffhanger:**  
* You are **engaged in a fierce battle** against Demetria and her gygan guardian.  
* The fate of the remaining enchanted teenagers and the **Horn of Balmytria** hangs in the balance.  
* Your next actions will determine whether you can defeat Demetria, reclaim the horn, and fulfill one of your **Great Labors**.  
  **Key Points to Remember for Next Session:**  
* **Demetria** is a powerful **dryad** with dangerous magic and a deep-seated vendetta against mortals.  
* The **gygan** is a formidable opponent due to his multiple arms and combat prowess.  
* **Loreus** may still be under Demetria's charm, so be cautious of his actions.  
* Utilizing strategy and perhaps finding a way to break Demetria's control over Loreus could turn the tide of battle.  
* Time is of the essence to save any remaining teenagers and prevent Demetria from enacting further dark rituals.

# Session 6 {#session-6}

Agenda

* Finish investigating the mossy temple and recover the horn of Balmytria  
* Delphi wants to buy some equipments next week  
* Next week we will go to the necropolis 

Notes:

* **Conclusion of the Battle with Demetria:**  
  * Resuming the intense combat in the feasting hall of the Mossy Temple, you faced Demetria, the vengeful dryad, and her formidable gygan guardian.  
  * **Aella** delivered a critical strike against Demetria, severely wounding her.  
  * **Delphi** swiftly cast a sleep spell, successfully rendering Demetria unconscious.  
  * Seeing an opportunity to avoid further bloodshed, **Astreus** used his silver tongue to persuade the gygan to lay down his arms and flee the battle.  
  * With the immediate threats neutralized, you securely tied up Demetria to prevent any further mischief.  
* **Retrieving the Horn of Balmytria:**  
  * **Delphi** retrieved the coveted **Horn of Balmytria** from the feasting table.  
  * Fulfilling one of your Great Labors, Delphi drank from the horn and immediately fell into a deep, dream-laden slumber.  
  * You recognized this as a sacred experience linked to your destiny.  
* **Exploration of the Mossy Temple:**  
  * While Delphi rested, the rest of you explored the remaining chambers of the temple.  
  * You discovered Demetria's private quarters, which contained a locked chest.  
  * Successfully picking the lock, you found valuable treasures, including coins, jewelry, and an ominous tome bound in human skin.  
  * Understanding the dark nature of the book, you decided to take it with you for proper disposal.  
* **Return to the Dragon Shrine:**  
  * With your mission in the Oldwoods complete, you escorted the rescued teenagers, including **Corinna** and **Sostrate**, back to Estoria.  
  * At the **Dragon Shrine**, you returned the Horn of Balmytria to **Aesop**, the shrine's keeper.  
  * Each of you participated in the sacred ritual of drinking from the horn, as required by your quest.  
  * Upon drinking, you all experienced vivid dreams of standing aboard a ghostly ship, the legendary **Ultros**, holding a mysterious bronze device resembling a compass.  
* **Interpreting the Visions:**  
  * Aesop helped interpret your dreams, explaining that the Ultros is a cursed ship captained by the infamous Dragonlord **Estor Arkelander**.  
  * The bronze device you saw is likely the **Antikythera**, a magical compass said to navigate any sea, including the mystical Forgotten Sea.  
  * These visions hinted at future challenges and the importance of seeking out the Ultros and the Antikythera.  
* **Addressing the Cursed Necklace:**  
  * Aesop informed **Delphi** that to lift the **curse of the graverobber**, the emerald necklace he carried must be returned to its rightful place in the **Necropolis at Telamok**.  
  * Understanding the urgency, you agreed to undertake this task to free Delphi from the curse.  
* **Disposing of the Evil Tome:**  
  * **Astreus** presented the sinister book found in Demetria's chambers to Aesop.  
  * Grateful for removing such a dangerous artifact from circulation, Aesop safely disposed of it.  
  * As a token of appreciation, he gifted Astreus a **potion of heroism**.  
* **Parley with the Centaurs:**  
  * Seeking a resolution to the looming threat against Estoria, you approached the centaur encampment under a flag of truce.  
  * You met **Baenor**, the centaur chieftain, who was leading the forces gathered north of the city.  
  * Baenor challenged you to single combat, offering a chance to deter the centaur assault if you proved victorious.  
  * He also proposed that you could offer yourselves as sacrifices to **Sydon** in place of **Princess Anora**.  
  * After deliberation, you declined both offers, recognizing the risks outweighed the potential benefits.  
* **Journey to the Necropolis at Telamok:**  
  * Deciding to pursue your next Great Labor, you set out for the Necropolis, a sacred burial site of the ancient Dragonlords.  
  * The journey took approximately six hours, leading you into the icy reaches of the **Mithral Mountains**.  
  * As you ascended the **Path of the Dead**, you prepared for dangers by plugging your ears with wax to guard against creatures that use enchanting songs.  
* **Encounter with the Harpies:**  
  * Along the narrow mountain path, you were ambushed by three harpies whose alluring songs could lure travelers to their doom.  
  * Thanks to your precautions, you resisted their enchantments and engaged them in combat.  
  * You successfully defeated the harpies, sending their bodies plummeting into the mist-filled chasms below.  
* **Meeting the Silent Guardian:**  
  * At the entrance of the Necropolis, a silent, skeletal guardian barred your passage.  
  * He extended a bony hand, demanding a **burnished coin of the Dragonlords** as payment to enter.  
  * Respecting the sacred traditions, you offered the coin, and he stepped aside, granting you entry.  
  * The guardian warned you that disturbing the tombs could invoke curses upon you.  
* **Lifting Delphi's Curse:**  
  * **Delphi** presented the cursed necklace to the guardian.  
  * The skeletal figure accepted it, returning it to its rightful place within the Necropolis.  
  * As a result, the curse afflicting Delphi was lifted, freeing him from its adverse effects.  
* **Exploration of the Necropolis:**  
  * You carefully navigated the ancient tombs, taking care not to disturb the resting places of the honored dead.  
  * The Necropolis was vast and solemn, each tomb a monument to the heroes of old.  
  * **Delphi** felt a profound connection to this place, seeking clues about his destiny as the **Vanished One**.  
  * **Raina**, remembering her path as the **Haunted One**, realized that interrogating Demetria might reveal vital information about her past and the mysteries that haunt her.


# Session 7 {#session-7}

Agenda

* Continue exploring the Necropolis at Telemok  
* Delphi wants to know about his destiny here: the vanished one  
* Remind Raina about her epic path:  The Haunted One; Demetria needs to be interrogated by Raina to find out the connection to her path 

Continuing on

* **Descent into the Depths of the Necropolis:**  
  * Continuing your quest to retrieve the **Armaments of the Dragonlords**, you delved deeper into the sacred **Necropolis at Telamok**.  
  * The air grew colder and the silence more profound as you ventured further into this ancient city of the dead.  
* **Attempt to Access Balmytria's Tomb:**  
  * You approached the grand mausoleum of **Balmytria**, the legendary silver dragon.  
  * Despite your combined efforts, the colossal marble lid of her sarcophagus remained immovable, sealed by magic or divine will beyond your current power.  
* **Entering the Maze of Xander's Tomb:**  
  * Turning your focus to the tomb of **Xander**, the first and greatest of the Dragonlords, you stood before its imposing entrance.  
  * A bronze statue of a kneeling minotaur guarded the doorway, its silent vigil adding to the tomb's mystique.  
  * Intricate mosaics adorned the entry hall, depicting Xander's heroic deeds and epic battles against formidable foes.  
* **Navigating the Labyrinth:**  
  * Inside, you found yourselves within a **labyrinthine maze**, designed to deter and confound intruders.  
  * As you carefully traversed the twisting corridors, the shadows seemed to shift, and the weight of history pressed upon you.  
  * **Delphi**, the **Vanished One**, felt a deep connection to this place, his destiny intertwined with the legacy of the Dragonlords.  
* **Battles with the Undead Guardians:**  
  * Skeletal warriors emerged from hidden alcoves, their ancient armor clattering as they moved to attack.  
  * Towering **minotaur skeletons** joined the fray, their hollow eyes burning with unholy light.  
  * You fought fiercely, combining your strengths to overcome these relentless guardians.  
* **The Deceptive False Tomb:**  
  * Your path led you to an ornate chamber housing what appeared to be Xander's sarcophagus.  
  * Sensing something amiss, you approached cautiously, only to trigger a deadly ambush.  
  * The sarcophagus revealed itself as a ravenous **mimic**, while a seemingly innocuous rug attempted to envelop you as a **rug of smothering**.  
  * Through quick thinking and determined combat, you defeated these cunning foes.  
  * On the north wall, you discovered a hidden lever. Pulling it, you heard the distant grinding of ancient mechanisms, echoing ominously through the halls.  
* **The Deadly Crushing Trap:**  
  * Pressing forward, you unknowingly activated an insidious trap.  
  * Massive stone walls began to close in on you, threatening to crush half the party in a merciless embrace.  
  * Panic surged as the space shrank; escape seemed impossible.  
  * **Rhaena**, your swift centaur companion, sprang into action.  
  * Racing back through the maze with unmatched speed, she retraced your steps to the lever in the false tomb.  
  * With moments to spare, she reset the mechanism, halting the crushing walls and saving your companions from a grisly fate.  
* **Confrontation with Graxis, the Minotaur Guardian:**  
  * At last, you reached the true heart of Xander's tomb.  
  * As you entered the sanctum, a menacing figure loomed from the shadows—**Graxis**, a formidable minotaur warrior and the tomb's guardian.  
  * His voice echoed with contempt: "Intruders\! You defile the resting place of the great Xander. Your trespass ends here\!"  
  * Wielding weapons of legendary craftsmanship, Graxis charged, initiating a battle that would test your mettle.

# Session 8 {#session-8}

Agenda

* Defeat Graxis and recover the weapons of the dragonlords from the tomb of Xander  
* Make our way to the mithril forge and discover its secrets  
* Return to the Estoria and deal with the Centaur Army menacing the city; either by fighting their chieftain in single combat, Replacing princess Anora as a sacrifice; or some other clever means

Log

* **The Battle of Graxis**: Our heroes faced the bloodthirsty minotaur Graxis in the chilling depths of the Necropolis. Raina bravely leapt onto Xander's sarcophagus, desperately trying to keep it closed as Delphi held the front line, casting spells to protect the party. However, Graxis struck back fiercely, nearly taking Delphi's life with his savage blows.  
* **The Awakening of Xander**: Mid-battle, Xander's sarcophagus opened, revealing the undead form of the first Dragonlord. With an air of silent authority, Xander recognized the heroes as the Chosen of the prophecy. Raina negotiated with the undead lord, who acknowledged the party's bravery and offered his aid.  
* **Victory and Gifts**: A well-placed arrow from Astraeus' bow struck Graxis, bringing the monstrous minotaur to his knees. Xander then rewarded the party with his legendary breastplate and the magical shield and axe once held by the minotaur. He also recognized Delphi as the **Vanished One** of legend, presenting him with the **Crown of the Dragonlords** and revealing a vital clue: Delphi's ancient armor had been stolen by the ruthless Gaius, commander of the Order of Sydon. It now lies hidden on the Island of Yonder.  
* **Consecrated Tombs and Treasures**: After leaving Xander to his eternal rest, the party continued their exploration. Raina used her Divine Sense to identify which tombs were consecrated. They soon entered the tomb of Telamok, awakening the vengeful wight within. After a fierce battle, they laid Telamok low and recovered treasures hidden among his bones.  
* **The Attack of the Black Puddings**: In the tomb of Cosmo Phobas, the walls were coated in black slime that morphed into deadly black puddings when disturbed. The fight was grueling as the oozes split with each slashing blow, forcing the party to retreat and regroup repeatedly. Astraeus' Bow of Cupidity managed to charm some of the slimes, helping them survive this relentless onslaught.  
* **A Close Call with the Golems**: In the tomb of Myrto, Delphi's curiosity led him to attempt to open the sarcophagus. This action animated a clay golem statue, which the party struggled to harm. Realizing the challenge was too great, they retreated as a second golem prepared to attack.  
* **Meeting the Centaurs and Reaching the Great Falls**: After resting in an empty tomb, the heroes left the Necropolis and descended into the mountainous paths around the Arkelon River. They encountered a troop of centaurs, who warned of troglodytes infesting the caves by the Great Falls and requested the party's help in finding two missing centaur warriors.  
* **Exploring the Falls**: Following the centaurs' warnings, the heroes reached the Great Falls of Arkelon. Amid the roar of the cascading water, they discovered the collapsed entrance of an ancient dwarven mine. With Aella's skillful tracking, they found a secret pathway leading behind the waterfall into the heart of the mountain.

Log  
**Arrival at the Great Falls of Arkelon**

* The party reached the breathtaking **Great Falls of Arkelon**, where the river cascades into a vast lake surrounded by colossal statues known as the **Hands of Kentimane**, the Elder Titan.  
* As they marveled at the sight, they noticed **disgusting troglodytes** climbing a rope ladder along the waterfall's side.  
  **Clash at the Waterfall**  
* Without hesitation, the heroes engaged the troglodytes in a fierce battle on the slippery cliffs beneath the roaring waterfall.  
* One troglodyte escaped inside the caves, sounding an alarm that brought more creatures rushing to the fray.  
* A full-scale skirmish erupted at the cave entrance, but the party held their ground.  
  **Venturing into the Troglodyte Caves**  
* Entering the **foul-smelling caverns**, the heroes were assaulted by an overwhelming stench.  
* Navigating the dark tunnels, they remained vigilant for ambushes from troglodytes known to camouflage against the cave walls.  
  **Rescue of the Captured Centaurs**  
* They stumbled upon a horrific scene: a centaur being **cooked alive over a pit** by several troglodytes.  
* Swiftly defeating the beasts, the heroes saved two centaurs, **Kaluk** and **Hirak**.  
  * **Hirak** was near death but was revived with **goodberries** provided by the party.  
* The grateful centaurs warned of the **intelligent troglodyte king** deeper within the caves and cautioned about the creatures' chameleon-like abilities.  
* Before departing to reunite with their tribe, they reminded the heroes to **blow the ivory horn** upon leaving to receive their promised reward.  
  **Stealthy Assaults and Cave Navigation**  
* **Aella** took the lead, stealthily moving through the darkness and **silently eliminating two troglodytes** with her chakram.  
* The party carefully navigated the winding passages, aware of potential ambushes and traps set by the cunning creatures.  
* **Delphi's** keen senses and magical prowess aided in detecting hidden enemies.  
  **Confrontation with the Troglodyte King**  
* Deep within the caverns, Aella discovered the **troglodyte king**, a towering figure wearing a **golden circlet**—a headband that granted him unnatural intelligence.  
* Seizing the moment, she attacked from the shadows, wounding him severely.  
* The enraged king summoned his minions, and a tense battle ensued.  
* **Delphi** cleverly cast a **web spell**, blocking two pathways and preventing reinforcements from overwhelming the party.  
  **The Riddle Challenge**  
* Recognizing the stalemate, the troglodyte king proposed a contest:  
  * If the heroes could answer his **three riddles**, he would surrender his **mithral scepter**, grant them safe passage into the dwarven mines, and share a valuable secret.  
  * Accepting the challenge, the party listened intently and, through teamwork and wit, **correctly answered all three riddles**.  
* True to his word, the king handed over the scepter and revealed the secret:  
  * The **dwarven elevator ahead was trapped** and required the dwarvish password "**Barazgul**" (meaning "mithral") to deactivate the deadly mechanisms.

  **A Tense Departure and Moral Conflict**

* As the heroes prepared to leave, Aella noticed the king's **smug smirk**, suspecting deceit.  
* Feeling disrespected, she **demanded the rest of his treasures**.  
* Reluctantly, the king surrendered his gold and mithral ingots but **refused to part with his magical circlet**.  
* **Kyra** warned that breaking their agreement could damage their reputation and **erode trust among allies**.  
  **Rest and Reflection**  
* Outside the caves, the party took a **short rest** to recuperate.  
  * **Delphi attuned to the scepter**, which emitted a mysterious black glow in the fading light.  
* They contemplated the moral implications of their actions, weighing the pursuit of justice against the value of honor.  
  **Exploring the Upper Levels of the Mithral Mines**  
* Re-entering the caves, they noticed that the **two-headed dog statue** that once guarded a stone bridge was **no longer there**.  
* Sending **Delphi's owl familiar** ahead, they observed:  
  * A **great chasm** plunging into the earth—the **Deep Shaft** leading to the lower mines.  
  * **Death dogs**—vicious two-headed hounds—gnawing on the **corpse of a massive three-headed cerberus**, hinting at the deadly creatures that now inhabited the mines.  
  * An **ornate bronze elevator of dwarven construction**, adorned with intricate engravings and ancient craftsmanship.  
* The owl spotted a **hastily scribbled note in dwarvish** near the elevator but couldn't get close enough to read it.

**Session 10 Recap: The Fires of the Mithral Forge**

* **Battle in the Dwarven Hall**  
  * After your stealthy approach faltered, you faced off against vicious death dogs feasting on the colossal corpse of a three-headed cerberus.  
  * The death dogs lunged, their diseased bites infecting Delphi.  
  * Together, you vanquished the beasts, cutting down the last one as it tried to flee.  
  * The air hung heavy with the scent of decay and ancient dust.  
* **Exploring the Dwarven Quarters**  
  * Venturing into the abandoned living quarters, you sifted through rubble and relics of a bygone era.  
  * Amidst the debris, you uncovered hidden treasures—glimmers of mithral and ancient dwarven craftsmanship overlooked by the troglodytes.  
  * The silent halls whispered tales of the dwarves who once toiled here, their presence felt in every stone.  
* **The Menace of the Cockatrices**  
  * Proceeding cautiously, you heard unsettling, chicken-like squawks echoing through the corridors.  
  * Aella scouted ahead, discovering an old storage room filled with rotten sacks and broken crates—a remnant of the mine's operational days.  
  * Further down, she spotted the Bird Pens: a chilling scene with a petrified troglodyte and a cockatrice lurking nearby.  
  * Formulating a plan, you barricaded the doorway with Rheana's help, using old crates to trap the creature inside.  
* **Confrontation in the Barracks**  
  * Across the hall, you encountered three more death dogs turned to stone, guarded by two vigilant cockatrices.  
  * The cockatrices screeched and attacked, their beady eyes glowing with arcane menace.  
  * Aella narrowly avoided their petrifying gaze before you swiftly dispatched them, ensuring the safety of the passage.  
* **The Deceptive Elevator Trap**  
  * Returning to the dwarven elevator, you noticed a hastily scribbled note in Dwarvish near the door—a cryptic reminder about a password.  
  * Trusting the troglodyte king's word, you recited "Barazgul" (meaning "mithral") as you descended.  
  * Alarms blared as oil began seeping from dragon-shaped spouts—realizing too late that the king had deceived you.  
  * Thinking quickly, Delphi reversed the elevator's direction, ascending as the flow of oil subsided.  
  * Determined to outsmart the trap, you clogged the dragon mouths with debris, reducing the impending flames' impact.  
  * The elevator descended once more; flames erupted but were dampened by your quick thinking, allowing you to reach the lower levels singed but alive.  
* **The Silent Armory**  
  * Stepping into a vast armory once brimming with legendary weapons, you found only echoes of the past.  
  * Empty racks and shattered armaments told stories of looting and time's relentless decay.  
  * Despite thorough searching, valuable relics eluded you, perhaps hidden or long removed.  
* **Encounter with the Forgekeeper**  
  * Moving south, you discovered a grand chamber dominated by a bubbling pool of lava—a creature swam beneath its molten surface.  
  * Two death dogs guarded an enigmatic bronze sphere with a protruding spout.  
  * Without hesitation, Aella led the charge against the guardians.  
  * Rheana invoked the **Fear of the Dragonlords**, her presence unsettling the death dogs and giving you the upper hand.  
  * Upon their defeat, a serpentine figure emerged from the lava—the salamander known as Pyra, the Forgekeeper.  
  * She warned of the enchanted sphere, a deadly trap designed by the dwarves to keep her bound.  
* **Disarming the Frozen Trap**  
  * Investigating the sphere, you attempted to disable it but only delayed its activation.  
  * As ominous clicks sounded, Pyra urged you to flee before a blast of freezing magic engulfed the room.  
  * Refusing to be thwarted, you heaved the sphere onto Rheana's sturdy back.  
  * With a combined effort, you hurled it over the edge, watching as it plummeted into the waterfall below—its icy explosion freezing the cascading waters momentarily.  
* **Alliance with Pyra**  
  * Grateful for your intervention, Pyra introduced herself and revealed her plight.  
  * Tricked by the dwarves, she had been bound to power the forge for centuries.  
  * She offered to reignite the legendary Mithral Forge if you agreed to destroy the rune tablet anchoring her to this place.  
  * Pyra cautioned you about the young cerberus ahead, a fearsome guardian sent by Lutheria herself.  
  * She suggested diplomacy but remained ready to assist in battle if needed.  
* **The Fierce Battle with the Cerberus**  
  * Undeterred, Delphi approached the cerberus, attempting to negotiate.  
  * The beast snarled, its three heads echoing with malice, and vowed to devour you all.  
  * The fight was brutal—the cerberus's powerful jaws and venomous bites pushed you to your limits.  
  * Pyra joined the fray, ensnaring the creature with her fiery tail and encasing one of its heads in hardened magma.  
  * Amidst the chaos, several of you suffered grievous wounds and the sting of poison.  
  * In a final, decisive move, Delphi unleashed a scorching firebolt, striking down the monstrous hound.  
* **Liberation and Rekindling the Forge**  
  * Among the cerberus's hoard, you found treasures and the rune tablet binding Pyra.  
  * Honoring your promise, Delphi shattered the tablet; Pyra sighed with relief as the ancient bonds dissolved.  
  * In gratitude, she descended into the depths, her fiery essence merging with the forge's heart.  
  * The Mithral Forge roared back to life—the chambers illuminated by the glow of molten metal and the rhythmic pulse of ancient machinery.  
  * As you caught your breath, the distant sound of gears turning signaled the elevator's activation.  
  * **Something—or someone—was descending from above, drawn by the forge's awakening...**

**Unexpected Arrival:**

* As the heroes navigated the rekindled Mithral Forge, they sensed an impending threat. King Driptongue and his ruthless minions began descending the dwarven elevator, determined to seize control of the forge.  
  **Defensive Preparations:**  
* Pyra, the fiery Forgekeeper, teamed up with the party to set up intricate traps throughout the forge, preparing for the inevitable assault by the troglodyte horde.  
  **Hordes Descend:**  
* A relentless wave of troglodytes launched their attack on the forge's defenses, overwhelming the party with sheer numbers and vicious ferocity.  
  **Clash with the Troglodytes:**  
* In a fierce and harrowing battle, the heroes fought valiantly alongside Pyra. Amidst the chaos, Pyra ensnared King Driptongue with her mighty tail, forcing him to surrender.  
  **Aella's Ruthless Justice:**  
* Despite King Driptongue's pleas for mercy, the unyielding Amazon Warrior, Aella, delivered a brutal end to the tyrant, ensuring he would never threaten Estoria again.  
* Pyra cautioned Aella about the repercussions of such brutality, warning that the party's reputation could suffer, but Aella remained steadfast in her actions.  
  **Pyra's Offer:**  
* With King Driptongue defeated, Pyra revealed her ability to craft powerful items for the heroes, offering them legendary gear in exchange for their continued assistance.  
  **Night of Terror:**  
* Exhausted after the day's battles, the party spent the night within the Mithral Forge. They were plagued by a terrifying dream vision from the Titan Lutheria, waking up in cold sweats and experiencing short-term madness.  
  **Centaur Gratitude:**  
* Following the harrowing night, the heroes returned to the banks of the Arkelon River to receive their reward from the centaurs: three potions of heroism, tokens of gratitude for rescuing their missing kin.  
  **Meeting with Volkan:**  
* Back in Estoria, the party consulted with Volkan, the grumpy dwarven blacksmith and true God of the Forge. He explained that he needed King Pythor's hammer to repair the party's broken weapons and armor.  
* The heroes hired Volkan to craft a special suit of plate armor for Rhaena, costing 1500 gp and taking four days to complete.   
  **Hunting the Basilisks:**  
* Determined to eliminate the threat to Princess Anora, the party ventured to the Rock of Estor in search of the petrifying basilisks.  
* Delphi, utilizing his mystic abilities, summoned an octopus familiar to scout the river upstream. The octopus successfully located the basilisks' lair within a hidden cave.

Log  
**The Basilisk Cavern**

* Deep within the rocky gorge, you descended into the lair of the deadly basilisks. These monstrous creatures, harbingers of petrification, had claimed the lives and freedom of many—including a group of ill-fated bandits now frozen in stone.  
* **The Battle:** You fought valiantly against these creatures, narrowly avoiding their petrifying gazes. Each strike of your weapons reverberated through the cavern, and though the battle was fierce, your resolve never wavered.  
* **The Spoils of War:** You harvested precious basilisk ichor, a key alchemical component. Some will be used to craft a salve to cure petrification—others, perhaps, for darker purposes. From the corpse of a basilisk, you claimed its fearsome head, destined to enhance a magical shield under the skilled hands of Volkan, the God of the Forge.  
* **A Choice Left Behind:** Despite recovering the salve, you chose not to release the petrified bandits—a somber reminder of the cost of greed and violence in the wilds of Thylea.  
* **The Hidden Treasure:** In the shadowy depths of the cavern, you uncovered a trapped chest filled with modest loot, adding a small glimmer of triumph to the grim surroundings.  
  **The Centaur Encampment**  
* On your journey back to Estoria, the sound of drums and hooves led you to the centaur encampment, where the air crackled with tension and ancient grievances.  
* **Baenor's Words:** Meeting with Baenor, the chieftain of the centaurs, you explained your plan to take Princess Anora's place as a sacrifice to Sydon. Baenor's sarcasm was biting as he wished you "good luck," urging you to deal with Gaius and pray to your gods and ancestors—for your souls were already in peril.  
  **Negotiating with Gaius**  
* Back in King Pythor's palace, you stood before the heavily-armored Gaius, commander of the Order of Sydon. With determination and Astreus's silver tongue, you convinced him to accept your self-sacrifice in place of Anora.  
* **The Bargain Struck:** Gaius reveled in the deal, mocking your bravery as four heroes offered themselves in exchange for what he considered a "useless princess." However, you cunningly persuaded him to move the sacrifice to the following night, saving precious time for your preparations.  
  **A Royal Thanks**  
* King Pythor, overcome with gratitude, summoned Princess Anora. She tearfully thanked you for your noble choice, gifting you a **magical pendant** to bring you luck as you face the horrors of the Rock of Estor.  
* **The King's Hammer:** Pythor promised his magical hammer as your reward if you survive. This weapon, forged by Volkan and steeped in divine power, is a treasure of legend and a beacon of hope for Estoria.  
* **Anora's Warning:** She urged you to leave your equipment with her to avoid it being pilfered by Sydon's acolytes during the ritual.  
  **Demetria's Prison**  
* In the depths of Pythor's dungeon, you confronted Demetria, the vengeful dryad who once twisted innocent souls into monstrous maenads in her service to Lutheria.  
* **The Heirloom's Secret:** Rheana demanded the return of her family ring, a precious artifact connected to her forgotten lineage and prophecy. Demetria, bitter and defiant, refused at first but relented after being put to sleep and swearing an oath to the party.  
* **The Oath Fulfilled:** Bound by her words, Demetria produced the ring like a magician, conjuring it from thin air. She revealed that the Ritual Tome—her dark grimoire of transformation—had been a gift from her mistress, Lutheria.  
* **Freedom Granted:** Though wary, you honored her oath, releasing her from captivity. With haughty arrogance, Demetria departed the palace, her connection to Lutheria an ominous thread still tied to your fates.  
  **A Declaration to Estoria**  
* Delphi, ever the voice of the people, announced your intention to stand in Anora's stead to the bustling agora. A crowd gathered, whispering of your courage and folly in equal measure. Delphi assured them that the gods themselves would protect you, turning the sacrifice into a spectacle for all to witness.  
  **Evening Preparations**  
* As night fell, you each took to your tasks:  
  * **Astreus's Performance:** At the Dragon's Tooth Inn, Astreus captivated the crowd with music, his lute case overflowing with coins by the end of the night.  
  * **Aella's Watchful Eye:** Aella's mechanical bird soared back to the basilisk cave, ensuring no further dangers stirred within its depths.  
  * **Delphi's Vigil:** Delphi shadowed Gaius through the darkened streets of Estoria, uncovering the location of an unassuming house frequented by acolytes of Sydon.

  **Lutheria's Wrath**

* In the dead of night, the shadow of Lutheria descended upon your dreams. Each of you was plagued by visions of terror and madness:  
  * **Rheana's Torment:** Hallucinations of Lutheria's scorn haunted Rheana, her reflection twisted in the mirror and the night sky. Drawing upon her paladin's grace, she calmed her mind and banished the horrors.  
  * **Aella's Silence:** Stricken by an unnatural dumbness, Aella's voice was stolen, leaving her unable to speak. Despite your efforts, the curse lingers, a cruel reminder of Lutheria's power.  
  * **A Frightened Resolve:** As dawn approaches, you wake shaken but determined. The stakes have never been higher, and Lutheria has made her disdain for you clear.

* **Party:** Estoria is under siege by a formidable centaur army demanding the sacrifice of Princess Anora to appease the Titan Sydon. You have agreed to stand in the place of Princess Anora as a sacrifice to Sydon. You have cleverly slain the fiendish basilisks in their cave and now must survive tomorrow night, chained to the rock of Estor.   
* **Party:** Recover Pythor's Hammer from King Pythor and then Volkan can use it to repair your damaged items

Log

* We started by going to the dragon shrine to heal aella.   
* Aesop the cleric agrees to attempt a healing ritual on Aella for 150gp, but he needs 100gp worth of diamond dust to perform the ritual  
* We head to the Agora to buy diamond dust  
* On our way there, dragon knights of Mytros fly down from the sky and land in the public square to the astonishment of everyone. they said that king acastus of mytros requires our presence as soon as possible at the palace in mytros. There is a big hurricane threatening the city with Sydon as its author.   
* Delphi detects some hidden deeper meaning in the knights' summons.  
* We return to the basilisk cave and burnt the bodies and buried the remains so that nobody will find them or notice them missing.  
* The acolytes of Sydon lead us to the rock of estor as the sacrifice ceremony begins. Weare chained at the ankle to the rock of Estor.  
* The sun is going down and three harpies fly out of the sky and attack\!  
* Delphi succumbs to their magical song and is charmed.  
* Delphi's owl familiar attacks delphi and uncharms him from the harpies' song.  
* The party throws rocks and Astreus opens his mouth and shoots beams of eldritch energy like 80's dune hitting the harpies as they swoop out of the sky and attack the party.  
* They defeat the harpies and no basilisks show up.  
* Gaius and the acolytes of Sydon are very disappointed. When the next morning comes, they have to free the heroes and admit that the terms of the deal have been fulfilled.  
* The centaur army gradually starts packing up and leaving  
* The next morning the heroes are victorious  
* Pythor celebrates with the heroes and gives them his hammer  
* Pythor swears an oath of service to the party because we sacrificed the huge boar to him earlier in our adventures.  
* Volkan offers to repair the heroes damaged items with Pythor's hammer at the mithral forge and he sets out there to reaquaint the forgekeeper Pyra  
* Pythor has declared a week of feasting and celebration in the heroes honor  
* We leave right away to go to Mytros in the company of the Knights of Mytros  
* We arrive outside the gates and there is a huge hurricane\!  
* From the clouds we can see the angry visage of Sydon and he throws a huge lightning bolt down at our feet. We barely leap out of the way in time and several party members are injured\!  
* An air elemental emerges from the impact crater and immediately attacks\!  
* It is resistant to Aella's spinning chakram attacks and Delphi shoots lightning bolts at it which it also resists. It attacks Kyrah and she pulls out a wicked looking dagger and stabs it in the back as it flies away toward Astreus.  
* Finally the creature sucumbs to the multiple blows of the party and dissipates\!  
* We enter the city and all the people are inside out of the path of the storm  
* Some guards tell us how to get to the palace.  
* We enter the throne room and it is opulent. Over on the side of  the throne room is a huge silver dragon sitting on a pile of silver coins.

* **Aella:** Gather allies and return to the Isle of Themis and overthrow the usurpers who murdered your mother and stole her throne

* **Party:** Find out what is causing the storm over Mytros and investigate the goings on in the great city

Log

* We heard all the options to stop the hurricane:  
  * King Acastus: Suggests using powerful magic to control the weather, specifically the 8th-level spell Control Weather. He believes the heroes might possess or acquire the ability to perform such a feat, potentially through crafting the Boreal Harp.  
  * Commander Gaius:Demands the destruction of the Temple of the Five, arguing that Sydon's wrath can only be appeased by eliminating the worship of the Five Gods in Mytros. This would be a devastating blow to the faith and power of the gods.  
  * Chondrus (Emissary of Lutheria):Proposes offering seventy children to Lutheria to secure her intervention with Sydon. Though framed as an act of reverence, it is a horrifying and despised option, tantamount to sacrificing the innocent.  
  * Bella the Concubine: Suggests performing a traditional hecatomb—sacrificing 100 oxen to placate Sydon. This option would require significant resources, depleting the livestock of Mytros and straining its economy.  
  * Queen Vallus:Advocates for a miraculous act by the gods. She believes the Four Gods could combine their power to counter Sydon's storm, but this would come at great personal cost, permanently weakening their divine strength. The heroes must persuade the gods to agree.  
  * Kyrah, Goddess of Music:Proposes retrieving the Boreal Harp, a legendary artifact capable of calming storms and taming the winds. The harp is in the possession of Boreas, a satyr and former ally of Kyrah, who resides at a vineyard near the city. The heroes must negotiate, trick, or take the harp by force. Once obtained, the harp must be played in a masterful performance to dispel the storm and defy Sydon. This solution offers an adventurous and poetic alternative to the other grim proposals.  
* King Acastus promised to reward us with a map to the Ultros, the famous ship of Estor Arkelander  
* We get the sense that King Acastus is using us and we are just pawns for him.  
* The party met with Queen Vallus after their summit in the throneroom  
  * **The King's Deception:**  
    * Vallus revealed her husband's ulterior motives behind sending the party to recover the Ultros. She explained that Acastus was driven by troubling dreams and ambition, viewing the heroes as expendable tools in his schemes.  
    * She warned the party not to trust Acastus and urged them to return the Ultros to her instead, emphasizing the danger of Acastus consolidating power over both the Ultros and the dragons.  
  * **The Conflict in Mytros:**  
    * Vallus highlighted the growing tension between followers of the Five Gods and those of the Titans. She identified the Cult of Lutheria as a particular threat, operating under the guise of generosity while spreading corruption and Titan influence.  
    * She requested the party investigate the Temple of Lutheria in Stygian Row to uncover evidence of their malevolence, advising caution to avoid provoking chaos.  
  * **Personal Threads (Optional):**  
    * Vallus addressed specific party members' epic paths if applicable, offering tailored advice or quests. For instance, she mentioned the plight of the Amazons to an exile or directed a seeker of knowledge toward the Lotus Witch.  
  * **Final Warning:**  
    * Vallus reiterated that Acastus must not learn of the party's success with the Ultros, warning them of the dangers his control over the legendary ship could bring.  
* Before leaving the Queen's chambers, Aella met the Queen's Amazon   
  * Makhaira's Revelation: Aella's family was betrayed, her mother slain, and Aella framed as a coward by usurpers.  
  * Makhaira and her warriors were exiled for questioning the false rulers, later finding sanctuary with Queen Vallus.  
  * State of Themis: Shrines to the Great Mothers destroyed, replaced by Lutheria's statues.  
  * Usurpers rule through fear, with maenads and goatlings spreading chaos.  
  * Loyalists to the old ways hide in secret camps.  
  * Makhaira's Promise: Makhaira pledged to honor Aella's claim and support her when the time comes.  
  * She encouraged Aella to prove her worth by embodying strength and wisdom to unite the Amazons.  
  * Advice for Aella:  
  * Seek loyalists among the hidden camps on Themis.  
  * Prepare to lead with courage and inspire the sisterhood to rise against the usurpers.  
* We talk to the dragon Icarus and Delphi notices that he acts younger than a dragon of his size and age should. Delphi gives him a platinum piece and the dragon hopes there will be more where that came from.  
* The party made their way through the hurricane swept streets of the city toward the vineyards on the outskirts of the city.   
* We beat the acolytes of sydon who were vandalizing the statue of Vallus outside the temple of the five. We killed their leader and made the rest of them promise to clean up the vandalism they did to Vallus's statue  
* We crossed the bridge onto the other side of the city and encountered a woman trying to drive her horses through the storm. They horses were very frightened and the cart was nearly flung off the bridge because of a damaged wheel  
* The heroes calmed the horses and repaired the wheel using their mending magic.   
* The woman introduced herself as Thalia the alchemist and rewarded us with a potion of Nectar of Vitality. We thanked her and said we would visit her shop: Thalia's Elixers, after we dealt with the storm.  
* On the outskirts of town, we came under attack by a pack of storm harpies who flew down out of the sky, attacking us with their storm song and lightning. We slew them after a tough battle  
* Continuing on, we reach the edge of Boreas's Vineyard.  
* We notice that the violent hurricane is not really affecting the vineyard. We can see its effects battering the countryside outside of its bounds  
*  Kyrah revealed some of her past with Boreas. They had a falling out several years ago.  
  * **Kyrah's Past with Boreas:** Kyrah, once known as Notos, was part of the Four Winds, a group of musicians who inspired others through their music. Boreas, the Winter Wind, was a former companion who became envious of the Boreal Harp's power.  
  * **Betrayal and Conflict:** Boreas, influenced by Lutheria, stole the Boreal Harp after feeling betrayed when Kyrah shifted her focus to helping others, like the party. He now resides in the vineyard and will not part with the harp willingly.  
  * **Kyrah's Regret and Warning:** Kyrah expresses regret for not revealing this sooner, acknowledges her past failures, and warns the party to be cautious with Boreas, who thrives on chaos. She places her trust in them to succeed where she could not.  
* We enter the vineyard and wonder at the bounty of delectable grapes  
* We discover the Sylvan compass and Astreus reads the script around it in Sylvan, although we don't figure out what its purpose is  
* We knock on the front door of the Villa and are met by the Evelina. She is taking care of the two Satyr children.   
* She asks us if we are here to buy wine and we tell her we are looking for Boreus. She says he is not at home and offers us two varieties of delicious wine, one of which casts "calm emotions" on us.  
* We convince her to let us stay the night and she agrees for a price of 10 silver each.  
* She says we can walk up the river and go look for Boreus who is probably playing his harp and entertaining the river nymphs. She says for us to come back in an hour or two and she will feed us dinner. We will stay in the guest room and she will make us a hot bath.  
* We follow the river north and discover Boreas playing his harp for a bunch of river spirits. When we approach they all leap into the river and disappear from sight.  
* He addresses us with disdain and sarcasm, implying that Kyrah is using us.   
* Delphi starts talking to him to try and get him to act more agreeable to us. Delphi rolls very poorly on his persuasion check and the party's bard Astreus swoops in, using his powers of persuasion and rescues the situation. Astresus rolls very well on his persuasion and gets Boreas to warm to the party. He agrees to come back to the Villa and eat dinner and play music with the party and Kyrah.  
* We return to the Villa and have a nice dinner and magical wine. and play music and recount old times together

Log

**A Morning of Farewells**

* The party awoke well-rested in Boreas' villa, the storm-muted vineyard offering a brief reprieve from the chaos outside.  
* After intense negotiations, Boreas agreed to trade the Boreal Harp for Astreus's magical lute, an exchange that cemented mutual respect between the party and the satyr.  
* Evelina and Boreas bid the party farewell with a mixture of gratitude and caution, urging them to be safe in the storm-ravaged world beyond the vineyard's magical protection.  
  **Return to the Storm**  
* As the party trekked back through the hurricane-swept vineyards into Mytros, the storm's fury surged. Torrential downpours and gale-force winds made every step an arduous battle.  
* The streets of Mytros were a flooded maze. Slogging through the Temple District, the party passed the royal palace, its stoic walls battered by Sydon's wrath.  
  **A Heroic Rescue in the Chaos**  
* Along their path, the party came upon a collapsed home. Muffled cries from beneath the rubble spurred them into action.  
* Delphi used his magic to clear debris while the rest of the party dug through the wreckage. Their efforts inspired nearby neighbors, who joined in to pull the survivors to safety.  
  **The Impassable Steps**  
* The path to Mount Volkan's summit was blocked by a mudslide, forcing the party to detour through **Stygian Row**, the city's slums.  
* There, they discovered a man turned to stone. Using their magical ointment, they restored him, and he warned them about the Cult of the Snake, led by the enigmatic Lady of Coins.  
* He pointed them toward the Satyr's Tail, a seedy watering hole where they could learn more about this mysterious faction. The party marked it on their map before continuing north.  
  **The Treacherous Ascent**  
* The climb up Mount Volkan proved perilous, with rockslides threatening to sweep the party away.  
* A falling boulder injured Kyrah, who smashed her ankle but waved off the party's concerns, determined to see the mission through.  
  **The Ritual at the Summit**  
* At the mountain's peak, the party reached the storm-battered arena of the Great Games.  
* Kyrah provided instruction for the ritual, cautioning that Sydon would not sit idly by as they attempted to break his storm.  
* With the Boreal Harp in hand, Astreus began the minute-long ritual to counter the storm.  
  **Sydon's Wrath**  
* As the harp's magic began to weave, Sydon sent his forces to disrupt the ritual. Elementals of wind and water descended, along with storm-touched beasts and zealous servants of the Lord of Storms.  
* The party fought valiantly, protecting Astreus while he performed the delicate ritual. The battle was fierce, with Sydon's fury shaking the very mountain, but the heroes emerged victorious.  
  **A Triumph Against the Storm**  
* With a final, resonant chord from the Boreal Harp, the ritual was complete. The skies began to clear, and Sydon's storm was driven back, saving Mytros from destruction.  
* Kyrah congratulated Astreus on his flawless performance, her pride evident despite her injury. She declared this victory one that bards would sing of for generations.  
  **A Moment of Reflection**  
* The storm now abated, the party stood atop Mount Volkan, their weary faces illuminated by the first rays of sunlight breaking through the clouds. They had done what many thought impossible—defied a Titan and given Mytros hope.

### **Recap of Session 16: "Through the Storm and Shadows"** {#recap-of-session-16:-"through-the-storm-and-shadows"}

* **The Descent from Mount Volkan:**  
  * After dispelling Sydon's hurricane with the power of the **Boreal Harp**, the heroes began their descent from **Mount Volkan**, a place steeped in divine significance as the namesake of **Volkan, the God of Forges**. The mountain's harsh cliffs and storms tested their resolve one last time.  
  * They stumbled upon the **nest of a wyvern pair**, but their attempt to sneak past failed. The **female wyvern attacked**, knocking **Aella** down the mountainside and leaving her clinging to life. **Rhena**, with the help of her dragon companion **Nyssi**, took charge, delivering decisive blows to slay the creature.  
  * The fight grew deadlier when the **male wyvern returned**. **Astreus** narrowly avoided death after being thrown off a ledge, and the party fought desperately to survive. Finally, they emerged victorious, recovering a **golden amulet** and a **wyvern egg**—a hard-won trophy of their courage.  
* **Return to Mytros:**  
  * The city of **Mytros** lay battered but not broken as its people worked to recover from Sydon's storm. On the streets, the **Cult of Lutheria** continued its efforts to sway the masses, distributing food and wine to the poor. Though their actions appeared charitable, the heroes knew their intentions were far darker.  
  * At the palace, **King Acastus** greeted the party warmly, rewarding them with a **map to the Ultros**, a legendary ship that could change the balance of power in Thylea. However, **Queen Vallus** privately warned the heroes of her husband's ambitions. She urged them to keep the ship out of his hands and gifted them a **Scarab of Protection** as a token of her support.  
* **The Agora and the Great Menagerie:**  
  * In the bustling **Agora**, the party sought to sell the **wyvern egg**. At the **Great Menagerie**, they encountered **The Collector**, a mysterious figure dealing in exotic creatures. Cages of rare and sorrowful beasts filled the area, reflecting the city's mix of wonder and cruelty.  
  * The heroes struck a deal, trading the egg for gold and the freedom of **Kaelon**, a captured centaur. Kaelon's story of being abducted by slavers resonated deeply with **Rhena**, whose own family's fate remained shrouded in mystery. His freedom was a small but meaningful victory.  
* **Rest and Reflection:**  
  * With the day's trials behind them, the party found brief respite in the palace, thanks to **Queen Vallus's hospitality**. After cleaning up and taking a well-deserved rest, they began preparing for their next steps.  
* **The Temple of Lutheria:**  
  * Turning their attention to the **Temple of Lutheria** in **Stygian Row**, the group found it far more refined than its surroundings suggested. The cultists welcomed the poor with food and wine, using these gifts to draw new followers into their fold.  
  * Posing as new devotees, the party gained entry to the temple. **Delphi's familiar** scouted the wine cellar below, but locked doors and lingering mysteries forced the group to retreat and gather more information before acting further.  
* **The Satyr's Tail:**  
  * Seeking answers about the **Cult of the Snake**, the group visited the shady tavern known as **The Satyr's Tail**. Two grizzled brothers shared cryptic information about the cult and its leader, the **Lady of Coins**, who rules over the slums with an iron grip. The brothers' demeanor suggested they were not to be trusted.  
  * Meanwhile, **Astreus** joined the tavern's performer, **Fryxon**, in a musical duet that won the crowd's favor. Afterward, Fryxon warned the party to be wary of the brothers, who had deep ties to the **Cult of the Snake** and their dangerous leader.

# Session 17 {#session-17}

Agenda

* **Aella:** Gather allies and return to the Isle of Themis and overthrow the usurpers who murdered your mother and stole her throne  
* **Astreus:** Queen Vallus has guided you to seek out the Lotus Witch, who may possess the fabled grimoire you need for your chronicles. She also suggested consulting the Fates, who could craft an artifact to help ensure you live to tell your tale.

* **Party:**   
  * We will investigate the cult of Lutheria  
  * We will Investigate the Cult of the Snake

Log

* We started at the Satyr's Tail, a crusty tavern in the slum. We finish talking with the bar tender and decide to shadow the two brothers, Neco and Grecos to figure out where their hideout is.  
* Delphi's owl familiar soared above Mytros' lamp-lit streets, its silent wings cutting through the gathering dusk as it tracked the brothers Nero and Grecos. Meanwhile, as your party waited in the shadows below, fate delivered an unexpected messenger: an envoy from Lord Taran Neurdagon himself, one of the city's most powerful merchants, bearing an offer of 5,000 gold pieces for the head of the mysterious Lady of Coins.  
* The owl's pursuit led to an abandoned tenement near the edges of Stygian Row, where you discovered a hidden entrance to the city's labyrinthine sewers. Though Aella's tracking skills served well in those fetid tunnels for a time, the maze-like passages eventually forced you to emerge near the harbor, your quarry lost in the darkness below.  
* After cleansing yourselves at the Bathhouse of Vallus, fortune smiled upon you through the whispers of street children, who spoke of strange comings and goings around the mighty Colossus of Pythor. This bronze guardian, one of the twin colossi that have watched over Mytros' harbor since before the First War, held secrets of its own. With Queen Vallus' aid securing the password, you ascended through the mechanical marvel, your excuses failing to convince the minotaur guards who recognized you instead as the heroes who had stopped Sydon's storm.  
* In the Colossus' head, overlooking the glittering harbor where ships swayed gently at anchor, came a revelation that struck to the heart of Aella's quest: The Lady of Coins unveiled herself as Moxena, sister to one of the very usurpers who had murdered Aella's mother on the Isle of Themis. Yet the truth proved more complex \- it was Moxena who had discovered young Aella that bloody night, and rather than following orders to kill the child, had secretly arranged her escape.  
* Having failed in her own later attempt to overthrow her sisters, Moxena now offers an alliance from her bronze sanctuary: aid in Aella's quest to reclaim her rightful throne, but first demands proof of loyalty \- Lord Neurdagon's head. Three petrified victims stand as silent witnesses to your oath, sworn not to reveal her hidden stronghold within the ancient Colossus.  
* The pieces of prophecy begin to align \- the Oracle's words about finding an ally "in the head of god" now ring with new meaning, though whether Moxena's offer represents salvation or a deeper betrayal remains to be seen. The path to Themis grows clearer, but as with all things in Mytros, the price of vengeance may prove steep indeed.

  * We have the map to the Ultros near The Dead Falls. We must recover it to continue our adventure

Log

* We end our visit with Moxena and her minotaur thugs show us out through the sewer entrance to the statue  
* We exit near the dockyard and make our way to the Neurdagon estate. We scout the place and debate our strategy for assassinating Lord Neurdagon  
* We decide to wait to slay him and make our way to the Thalia's Elixers  
* We buy three packets of dust of disappearance and notice the Ooze creature that Thalia has for sale  
* We decide to purchase the arcane creature and the magical jug that allows us to command it  
* Then we go to the temple of Lutheria and send out Delphi's owl to cause a distraction inside the temple  
* We pour the dust of disappearance on ourselves and sneak inside the temple  
* We lockpick the door down to the basement, but the cultists opens it for us in order to grab a crossbow to shoot down the owl. He opens the door for us and we sneak inside without anyone noticing  
* Down into the "wine cellar" and we are still invisible.  
* Our presence seems to agitate several shadows, creatures who haunt this area. They search around for but cannot find us because we are invisible, we leave the room and shut the door  
* Up the hallway we encounter a powerful looking acolyte. She appears to be guarding a prison like reinforced door.  
* Aella steals the woman's black sword and while invisible and draws her attention  
* The party attacks the woman while invisible, getting the drop on her wounding her greatly.  
* The woman unlocks the reinforced door and shuffles into the next room and everything is silent when that happens

## **The Temple's Hidden Depths** {#the-temple's-hidden-depths}

* Your invisibility held as you descended below the Temple of Lutheria, where rows of wine casks concealed a more sinister trade  
* In these depths, you met Lyra the Vigilant, one of the temple's trusted guardians  
* The silence spell that perpetually shrouded these chambers muffled your fight  
* When Lyra fell, her black sword \- a badge of her authority \- became yours

  ## **The Prison Below** {#the-prison-below}

* Behind the reinforced door lay the truth of the temple's wine merchant facade  
* Children from Stygian Row filled iron cages \- chosen because their families lacked the influence to seek justice  
* These were meant to be the cult's newest initiates, destined for dark ceremonies under the full moon  
* Lyra's desk held letters revealing the temple's true purpose \- human sacrifice masked by wine festivals

  ## **The Serpent's Power** {#the-serpent's-power}

* From the opened sewer grate emerged an ancient horror \- a serpentine creature of bone and malevolent magic  
* Its power turned Astreus against the party, proving why the temple chose these tunnels for their dark work  
* The creature's influence spread through your group like poison before retreating into the vast sewer network beneath Mytros  
* Even after breaking free, you felt the lingering touch of its evil

  ## **The Dark Ceremony** {#the-dark-ceremony}

* Beyond the prison, you witnessed High Priestess Septia herself leading a ritual  
* A victim lay bound upon the stone bier while cultists chanted in eerie silence  
* This was one of the monthly ceremonies that kept the temple's true masters in power  
* The chamber held dark treasures, including a mysterious floating tome that caught Delphi's eye

  ## **Queen Vallus's Justice** {#queen-vallus's-justice}

* The Queen of Mytros, herself a goddess of wisdom, recognized the evidence of corruption you brought before her  
* Each rescued child's story confirmed what she had long suspected about the wine merchant family  
* She mobilized her forces against the temple, specifically the amazon warrior Makhaira and her squad  
* Your reward was an elegant Handbag of Holding \- later traded to secure the dark tome from the raid

  ## **Flight to the Forge** {#flight-to-the-forge}

* Captain Sammy, a dwarf whose reputation on the river is unmatched, agreed to brave the dangerous rapids  
* Through the night, your magic aided her navigation of the treacherous waters of the Arkelon  
* Her ship, "The Mariner," proved worthy of its captain's confidence  
* By dawn, you'd reached the hidden entrance to the Mithral Forge

  ## **At the Forge** {#at-the-forge}

* Nyssi triggered the mechanism that parts the great falls, revealing the secret dock  
* Volkan and Pyrah had completed your commissions:  
  * Plate armor worthy of a hero  
  * Chakrams forged from pure mithral  
* Then Volkan revealed his discovery \- an ancient Keledone, one of the legendary mechanical servants  
* To restore this marvel would require both mithral and gold in significant quantities

# Session 20 {#session-20}

Log

* We were talking to pyra and volkan  
* Volkan told us about the keledone that bring us our crafted items

* We continue our journey to Estoria by boat with captain sammy  
* We visit Pythor and princess anora and they are discussing something

* We got some rumors from different people  
* And we met a lady who was lady who was a merchant and we were able to secure enough mitral items to make a ingot of mithral  
* We spent the night at the inn for free and got a long rest  
* The next day we hiked to the dead falls   
* We braved the violent rapids and narrowly escaped getting crushed inside of the gates of death wich almost crushed the party  
* We searched high and low for a way into the falls which appeared to drop into nothingness  
* But eventually we made our survival rolls and found the pathway down the side of the cliff and discovered  
* Then we found the secret inlet  
* There we found an old but well maintained warship  
* Some of the PCs had to levitate across the water and we boarded the vessel

Agenda

* **Aella:** Gather allies and return to the Isle of Themis and overthrow the usurpers who murdered your mother and stole her throne  
* **Astreus:** Queen Vallus has guided you to seek out the Lotus Witch, who may possess the fabled grimoire you need for your chronicles. She also suggested consulting the Fates, who could craft an artifact to help ensure you live to tell your tale.  
* **Delphi:** Xander gave you your crown and his mystic armaments. Your fabled armor has been stolen by Gaius, the commander of the Order of Sydon. He keeps your armor in his fortress on the Island of Yonder, which is heavily fortified. Versi told you about a brass dragon egg on Fire Island.  
* **Rhaena:** You have recovered your family ring, a lost artifact tied to your erased past. The whispers of your Mother urge you onward—to seek the greater family artifact held by the Amazon Queen, somewhere in the Cerulean sea.

Log

* The waters of the Dead Falls churned as you faced the legendary Dragonlord, Estor Arkelander. What began as a negotiation quickly devolved into an epic battle, with the ghost captain teleporting across his vessel, determined to claim one of you as his next vessel. The three Thanes—Metron the Navigator, Skathon the First Mate, and Davos the Quartermaster—honored their alliance with you, keeping the spectral crew at bay while joining your fight against their former captain.  
* With a thunderous crack, Estor's ghostly form collapsed under your combined assault, only to rise again as a towering skeletal monstrosity. The enchanted weapons of the ship—an animated armor and flying sword—rallied to your cause as you battled the undead Dragonlord. Through skill, determination, and no small amount of courage, you finally banished Estor's form.  
* As he faded from the helm of the Ultros, his hollow voice echoed across the deck: "You may claim this ship, but know this: you cannot be rid of me so easily."  
* In the aftermath of battle, you encountered the true heart of the vessel—Delphia, the dryad whose life was sacrificed to form the ship's mast. Her ethereal form explained the Ultros' mysterious workings and its ability to travel beneath the waters. Under her guidance, the ship dove beneath the dark waters of the Dead Falls, emerging moments later into the gleaming expanse of the Cerulean Gulf.  
* Your first destination was not Mytros, but the Mithral Forge upriver along the Arkelon. There you delivered the precious mithral bars needed to repair the Keledone, ensuring that Volkan and Pyra's divine craftsmanship would eventually reach your hands. Only then did you set course for the city of Mytros—though wisdom guided your decision to anchor offshore, away from prying eyes.  
* Under cover of discretion, you entered the city and sought audience with Queen Vallus. The Goddess of Wisdom received you warmly, presenting you with the Antikythera—an ancient navigational device that would guide your journey through the treacherous waters of Thylea. She revealed its crucial flaw: a missing gear that limited its functionality to the Cerulean Gulf, unable to chart paths into the more dangerous Forgotten Sea. The missing component, she informed you, was likely hidden on the Island of Yonder, guarded by Sydon's faithful.  
* Her expression grave, Queen Vallus delivered her most urgent warning: "You have but two short months before the Oath of Peace comes to an end: sixty days to confront Sydon in his tower at Praxys, and Lutheria on her throne in the Nether Sea. If you cannot renew the Oath of Peace in that time, then I fear to think of what will befall this city. The armies of the Titans will slaughter the people of Mytros and soak the land in blood."  
* Her eyes gleamed with a fierce determination as she continued, "The Titans are weaker now than they were in the First War. You would be wise to gather what power you can on your journey. With the right weapons and knowledge, perhaps you could even challenge the Titans directly, and destroy them for good."  
* King Acastus received your triumphant return with thinly veiled jealousy. Clearly surprised by your survival, he offered cold congratulations while issuing a warning: bring no further troubles to Mytros.  
* As word of your impending voyage spread through the city, gifts poured in from the citizens: sacrificial animals, enchanted arrows, and magical potions to aid your journey. One hundred brave souls volunteered to serve as your crew, with fifty required at minimum to man the oars of the mighty vessel.  
* Notable allies joined your cause: Pythor, God of Battle, though nursing a substantial hangover, pledged his divine might to your quest. The Amazon warrior Mahkeira signed on, bringing her considerable martial prowess. Queen Vallus entrusted Kyrah with a mysterious bronze casket.  
* At the docks, Versi the Oracle sought out Delphi, sharing vital information about a brass dragon egg located on Fire Island—corresponding to the Constellation of the Prisoner. With a kiss and an entreaty to return safely, she blessed his journey, adding yet another quest to your growing list of objectives.  
* Now, the legendary ship Ultros cuts through the waters of the Cerulean Gulf, its black sails billowing with favorable winds. The Antikythera is calibrated to the Constellation of the Prisoner, guiding you toward Fire Island, where legends say the Goddess of Swiftness remains trapped in eternal torment at the heart of a volcanic prison.

# Session 23 {#session-23}

**Quest Log Update: Voyage to Fire Island & First Contact**

* **Departure & Voyage:** Set sail from Mitros aboard the *Ultros*, guided by the Antikythera calibrated to the constellation of the Prisoner, destination Fire Island. The primary goal is to locate a brass dragon egg mentioned by Versi. During the three-day voyage:  
  * Delphi spent time scribing spell scrolls.  
  * Astreus attempted to use his harp to influence the weather and speed the journey but was unsuccessful this time. He utilized two days of downtime to craft 2 Potions of Healing.  
  * The clockwork Caledony delivered the repaired *Axe of Xander* and the *Shield of Volkan* to the ship. No further crafting instructions were given.  
*   
* **Encounter: Jazirat Zulhaf (The Island Turtle):** On the second day of travel, encountered an uncharted island. Took the dinghy ashore (Astraeus, Delphi, Aella, Rhaena, Kyra) to investigate.  
  * **Discovery:** The island sits unusually high on warm stones. Docked vessels included Aresian ships (identified by Delphi via their wolf emblem).  
  * **Maelon (Triton Guardian):** Met at a shrine. Maelon revealed the island is a massive, living turtle, a mobile sanctuary. He confirmed it offers protection from nightmares, specifically mentioning Lutheria's influence. Directed the party to other inhabitants.  
  * **Shazum (Marid Trader):** Encountered in his trading post. Learned the island's name, Jazirat Zulhaf, and that it can be found again by navigating using the "Najma Zulhaf" (Turtle Star). It can be visited between other voyages without extra travel time. Received a quest: Retrieve **fire snake eggs** from Fire Island for Shazum in exchange for a choice of rare materials (Orb of Star Metal, Mithral Ingot, Vial of Gorgon Blood, or Dragon Scales). Shazum's current special inventory was limited (Potion of Heroism). Heard rumors about the Four Winds musicians and Commander Gaius on Yonder.  
  * **Aresian Warriors:** Briefly interacted with warriors led by Captain Galenus. Confirmed they are from Aresia, seeking rare goods/texts. Shared rumors concerning the Myrmekes' reef at Titan's Folly and the Queen of Themis.  
  * **Sea Elves (Lissandra & Kahlir):** Met the two sea elves monitoring unusual ocean currents with strange instruments. They requested the party report any observed anomalies during their travels. Shared a rumor about chimeras near Chimera Island.  
  * **Lyra Padma (Innkeeper):** Visited the "Floating Lantern" inn. Sampled "Tide Whisperer" brew (granted temporary Aquan understanding and perception of faint oceanic whispers). Stayed overnight, receiving protection from nightmares, 10 temporary HP, and 24 hours of psychic damage resistance.  
*   
* **Arrival at Fire Island:** Departed Jazirat Zulhaf on Sunday morning. Arrived at Fire Island after 8 hours. Anchored the *Ultros* and took the dinghy ashore onto a volcanic beach. The island features dense jungle, a central active volcano emitting smoke, and the smell of sulfur.  
* **First Contact (Bloodscale Tribe):** Met on the beach by Sessith, a shaman from the Bloodscale lizardfolk tribe, accompanied by warriors. Sessith indicated Queen Vytha was expecting the party and requested they follow him.  
* **Jungle Ambush & Rescue:** Followed Sessith through difficult jungle terrain. Discovered Firewalker lizardfolk interrogating a bound blue-scaled lizardfolk prisoner (Ssythra, their tribe's Keeper of Histories) while menacing her with a fire snake. A Terrorsaur scout was spotted circling overhead.  
  * **Combat:** Agreed to help Sessith ambush the Firewalkers. Aella cast *Pass Without Trace*; Delphi cast *Bless*. Aella initiated combat with a surprise Chakram Technique attack (boosted by Astreus's Bardic Inspiration), hitting the leader and ricocheting to severely wound/kill the skirmishers and the fire snake. The leader used stealth to disappear. Delphi finished off the remaining wounded skirmishers with magic. The Terrorsaur fled.  
  * **Aftermath:** Freed Ssythra. She confirmed the attackers were Firewalkers allied with Sidon. She possesses knowledge regarding the brass dragon eggs (one hatched into King Jankor's pet Wyrmling, others may remain) and the location of fire snake nests. Agreed to guide the party to Queen Vytha.  
*   
* **Bloodscale Village & Audience with Queen Vytha:** Traveled further through the jungle to the Bloodscale settlement (huts on platforms over water, central ziggurat). Met Queen Vytha on the central platform.  
  * **Negotiation:** Vytha acknowledged prophecies foretelling their arrival and the conflict with King Jankor, who controls the volcano and serves Sydon. She requested the party's aid in defeating Jankor.  
  * **Offer & Dilemma:** In return for assistance, Vytha offered knowledge of the dragon eggs' location and a secret path into Jankor's volcano fortress. She then proposed a celebratory feast to seal the alliance, revealing the tribe's highest honor: the ritual sacrifice and consumption of her son (Karth/Skreel) to grant strength to the warriors, including the party. The son appeared solemnly ready to accept this fate. The session ended awaiting the party's response to this proposal.

**Current Objectives on Fire Island:**

* Respond to Queen Vytha's request for aid and her proposal for the feast.  
* Locate a brass dragon egg.  
* Potentially acquire fire snake eggs for Shazum.  
* Investigate King Jankor, his fortress, his alliance with Sydon, and the Staff of Thunder and Lightning.

* Received final instructions from Zatli regarding the secret path, known traps, and enemy locations.  
* Entered the volcano caldera via the secret path, aided by Aella's *Pass Without Trace*.  
  **Stealth & Combat:**  
* Successfully used Delphi's basilisk shield and coordinated attacks to silently eliminate two Firewalker guards patrolling a bridge.  
* Infiltrated a nearby sleeping chamber, eliminating two more guards using similar tactics (basilisk shield \+ attacks).  
* Looted a trapped chest within the sleeping chamber (Aella disarmed trap & picked lock).  
  **Reconnaissance:**  
* Used Delphi's owl familiar to scout ahead.  
* Observed the salamander cave, noting the presence of salamanders, eggs, and one uniquely different egg.  
* Observed the egg nursery cave, identifying two lizardfolk shamans, multiple fire snakes, and clutches of eggs.

  * **Made an Agreement:** Promised Steros passage off Fire Island and help finding his father.  
  * **Crucial Intel:** In return, Steros revealed the location of the last **Brass Dragon Egg**: it's in the cave used by the **Salamanders** as their nest.  
  * Steros is preparing to leave and will await the party's return.  
*   
* **Prisoners Rescued:** Found captured **Bloodscale Tribe** warriors (allies of Queen Vytha) held in cages.  
  * Intimidated the guards (using Jankor's captured staff) into fleeing.

  ### **Arrival at Themis** {#arrival-at-themis}

* **Journey:** Completed the 3-day journey to Themis (Constellation IX: The Twins).  
* **Landing:** Arrived at the western bay of Themis, accompanied by the Amazon exile **Makhaira**.  
* **Scouting:** Aella's rebuilt Stimfay scouted the area, reporting:  
  * Vast grasslands, unique fauna (giraffes, lions, rhinos, basilisks).  
  * Scattered war camps and patrols (rhino riders, basilisk handlers).  
  * An island in the eastern bay covered in statue-like figures, with stairs descending into the rock – likely the **Sacred Temple/Prison** stronghold.  
* **Next Destination Chosen:** Decided the next major island destination after Themis will be guided by Constellation IV: The Trickster (Chimera Island).

  ### **Current Situation** {#current-situation}

* Standing on the shores of Themis's western bay with Makhaira.  
* Aware of the general landscape and the location of the likely enemy stronghold in the east.  
* Tasked with finding allies and navigating the dangers of the Amazon island.  
* Oath of Peace Timer: Approx. 45-50 days remaining.

# Session 27 {#session-27}

* We scout the island and run into a troup of amazonian scouts. Aella is unable to convince them of her noble intentions and they fight to the death  
* We find very little evidence of organized civilization on the island except for one Island in the north east. There are many marble statues of various men and marble steps leading down into the earth.

# Session 28 {#session-28}

* The party landed on the small, statue-covered island in the eastern bay of Themis, believed to be a key location for the usurpers.  
* The island features numerous marble statues, primarily of naked men, some appearing scarred or maimed, with a central marble staircase leading down into the earth.  
* The Jancan, Steros, is with the party, hoping to find his father, Bront, who he believes is held captive on Themis.  
* Four marble statues (golems) at the top of the staircase animate and attack when men (Delphi or Astraeus) approach, but remain inert for women (Aella, Rhaena, Makaira).  
* The golems were discovered to regenerate damage unless their parts were removed and scattered. Dismembering them, particularly removing the head, was key to their defeat.  
* Delphi's owl scouted beyond the brass doors at the bottom of the staircase and observed two Amazon warriors inside, seemingly relaxed and playing a game.  
* Aella's Stimfay surveyed the island's exterior and found two potential alternative entrances:  
* A large, half-submerged stone culvert or pipe.  
* A narrow crack in the cliff face, currently at high tide, which might become accessible in approximately three hours as the tide recedes.  
* The party chose to confront the marble golems directly rather than wait for the tide or attempt the culvert.  
* After a difficult battle, all four marble golems were destroyed.  
* The brass doors leading into the Amazon's secret temple complex are now accessible to the party.  
* The party is battered and likely needs a short rest before proceeding further into the complex.  
* The DM indicated the party will level up upon successfully clearing the island of Themis.  
* This island is a significant step in Aella's epic path as "The Exile," marking her return to her homeland to confront those who usurped her mother's throne.

# Session 29 {#session-29}

**Objective:** Infiltrate the Sacred Temple on Themis to find allies and confront the usurper queen.

**Status:** In Progress

* **Entry to the Sacred Temple**

  * The party descended the marble staircase into the underground temple complex.  
  * Aella discovered the entrance mechanism: a rotating section of the bronze door with a hand-shaped imprint that granted entry.  
* **Basilisk Pens & Guard Post**

  * After a short rest, the party surprised and attacked the guards in the first chamber.  
  * Astraeus used his enchanted bow to charm an Amazon warrior named Talia.  
  * Aella killed the dwarven basilisk-keeper Nura and another Amazon warrior.  
  * The caged basilisks were neutralized by covering their pens with sailcloth.  
  * The bodies of the slain Amazons were thrown from the cliff.  
* **Intelligence from Talia**

  * The party interrogated the charmed Amazon, Talia, and learned key information:  
    * **Leadership:** The complex is ruled by the "false Queen" Thesilea VI and her sister, Leia. A third sister, Moxena, left Themis years ago.  
    * **Prisoners:** Captives include lizardfolk loyal to Queen Vytha, a giant Jancan blacksmith named Bront, and Darien, a high-ranking loyalist to the true queen imprisoned for 13 years.  
    * **The Statues:** The marble statues outside are the petrified "favored sons of Lutheria," who are sometimes fed to the basilisks.  
    * **Secret Entrance:** There is an underwater entrance to the temple, but Talia does not know its exact location.  
  * Talia was gagged and left tied up in the entry corridor.  
* **The Hydra Tunnels**

  * The party discovered the key to the next door was on Nura's necklace, which was on the body they had thrown off the cliff. Stimfay's search for the body was futile.  
  * After Aella picked the difficult lock, the party entered a corridor with honeycomb-like holes in the walls.  
  * Aella spotted a pressure plate trap on the floor. As she investigated, serpentine hydra heads lunged from the holes and attacked.  
  * Astraeus returned to Talia, who revealed the password to pacify the creature: "By the Grace of Lutheria."  
  * Whispering the password allowed safe passage but brought back unsettling memories of the party's nightmares from Lutheria.  
* **Amazon Barracks & The Prison Key**

  * The party found a side door leading to the Amazon Barracks.  
  * Astraeus peeked inside, spotting two warriors playing cards.  
  * The party stormed the room, with Rhaena and Aella quickly dispatching the two Amazons.  
  * A search of the bodies revealed a necklace heavy with keys.  
* **The Prisons & Darien**

  * The keys opened a heavy door in the barracks, revealing a hallway lined with prison cells.  
  * The party found two lizardfolk prisoners and a scarred, silent young woman.  
  * "The last cell housed a scarred, silent young woman.  
  * Recalling Talia's mention of an important prisoner named "Darien" loyal to the old ways, Aella attempted to speak to the woman, revealing her own identity and denouncing the usurpers. The woman remained unresponsive.  
  * Delphi detected a magical acoustic anomaly in the cell, suggesting a *silence* spell.  
  * Aella used the keys to open the cell door.

# Session 30 {#session-30}

### **Rescue & Alliances** {#rescue-&-alliances}

* **Darian Rescued:** The party freed Aella's childhood friend, Darian, from a magically-silenced prison cell, marking the first major step in reclaiming the throne.  
* **Allies Gained & Contained:** The captive lizardfolk, Skal and Veth, were freed. The charmed Amazon guard, Talia, was then imprisoned in Darian's former cell to keep her silenced.  
* **Arming for Vengeance:** The party looted the Amazon barracks, finding treasure (adamantine daggers, platinum), a sailor's map, and several strange items. They used the captured gear to arm the newly-freed Darian and healed her wounds.

### **Delving Deeper** {#delving-deeper}

* **Strange Encounters:** The party descended further, bypassing a mysterious cobalt-blue fountain and discovering a salon filled with a harem of dazed young men.  
* **A Demon's Tip:** In a ruined feast hall, the group met Voracia, a bored demon who, for her own amusement, pointed them toward the bedchamber of Leia, one of the medusa usurpers.  
* **The Lair of the Sister:** Avoiding a trap plate, the party found Leia's opulent room. Inside, the medusa was lounging with a minotaur companion, serenaded by a maenad musician, with the sound of crying infants coming from a nearby cradle.

### **The Ambush & The Twist** {#the-ambush-&-the-twist}

* **Perfect Assault:** The party launched a surprise attack, bursting in and quickly gaining the upper hand with a coordinated assault. Aella's chakram hit Leia, Rhaena's spear killed the minotaur, and magic from Astraeus and Delphi blasted the room.  
* **Petrifying Gaze:** The tide turned when Leia unleashed her power, instantly turning Astraeus and Delphi to stone.  
* **Deceit Revealed:** The "infants" in the cradle revealed their true forms as goatling tricksters. One of them polymorphed Makaira into a rat.

### **Victory from the Jaws of Defeat** {#victory-from-the-jaws-of-defeat}

* **Final Act of Power:** Just as all seemed lost, the stone-bound Delphi unleashed a final, maximized lightning bolt from a scroll, incinerating Leia and one of the goatlings.  
* **Reversal of Fortune:** With Leia's death, the polymorph spell on Makaira was broken. The remaining enemies, including the second goatling and the maenad musician, immediately surrendered.  
* **Restoration & Restocking:** The party used their last two doses of basilisk salve to cure Astraeus and Delphi. They then returned to the basilisk pens, killed the remaining beasts, and skillfully harvested a fresh supply of six doses of the petrification antidote.

# Session 31 {#session-31}

### **The Plan to Unmask the Queen** {#the-plan-to-unmask-the-queen}

* The party decided to descend back to the temple level where they had previously killed the medusa, Leia.  
* With the help of their companion Voratia, they identified the correct door leading to the Temple of Lutheria, where Queen Thessalia was performing a religious ceremony.  
* The group devised a plan to reveal Thessalia's medusa nature to her Amazon followers. Astraeus would cast *Mage Hand*, then turn invisible, sneak in, and remove the queen's helmet to expose her snake hair.  
* To aid in the infiltration, Aella cast *Pass Without Trace*.

### **Confrontation and Battle** {#confrontation-and-battle}

* Astraeus successfully snuck into the chamber while invisible and used the Mage Hand to remove the queen's platinum helmet, revealing her true form.  
* Thessalia accused Aella of bewitching her, while Aella denounced her as an evil usurper, initiating combat by throwing her chakram.  
* Initially, the five Amazon warriors in the room were confused about who to believe. After an impassioned plea from Darian, boosted by Astraeus's Bardic Inspiration, they became bewildered and chose not to fight for either side.  
* Thessalia began the fight by casting *Mirror Image* on herself. The party, including Delphi and Rhaena, focused their attacks on her, eventually destroying the illusory duplicates.  
* The queen's male tiefling attendant, Kazim, remained loyal and unsuccessfully attempted to cast *Hold Person* on Delphi.  
* Unlike her sister Leia, Thessalia's petrifying *Stone Gaze* was a three-stage effect, not an instant petrification. Delphi was briefly affected but managed to save himself from the effect later in the battle.  
* After being severely wounded by the party and seeing her attempt to be healed get thwarted by Delphi's *Counterspell*, Queen Thessalia offered to surrender.  
* Aella refused to show mercy, recounting the murder of her family. Hearing this, Thessalia took her own life.

### **The Aftermath and New Quests** {#the-aftermath-and-new-quests}

* With the usurper dead, the remaining Amazon warriors were left speechless and shattered.  
* Their leader, Colonel Ilia, declared that for Aella to be recognized as the true queen, she must complete a trial of strength: slay the Roc in the Forgotten Sea and bring back its head.  
* The party looted the treasure offerings in the temple. Rhaena discovered her greater family heirloom, a magical hovering chariot, and Aella found a powerful chakram that functions like a "Vorpal Lightning Bolt".  
* The party learned from the goatlings that there was a secret compartment in the statue of Lutheria. Inside, they found a valuable and magical black diamond.  
* They freed a group of brainwashed men who were being kept as "breeding stock". Astraeus used *Dispel Magic* to break their enchantment, and several agreed to join the ship's crew.  
* Finally, they explored the lowest level of the complex and freed the giant Jancan blacksmith, Bront, who is the father of their crewmate, Steros.  
* The goatlings also revealed that the former queen fed a powerful sword to the Hydra, creating an incentive for the party to hunt it down.

### **Wrapping Up and Future Plans** {#wrapping-up-and-future-plans}

* The party has gathered a significant amount of loot, including weapons, armor, and magical items from the armory. They plan to use the newly freed men to help carry it all back to the *Ultros*.  
* Everyone in the party will level up before the next session.  
* The party has decided on their next destination by choosing the Constellation of the Centaur. Their plan is to first visit Turtle Island and then proceed to the island indicated by the constellation.

# Session 32 {#session-32}

**Session Summary: Post-Themis & Return to Turtle Island**

The session began following the heroes' victory on Themis, where they defeated Queen Thesilea and liberated the Amazon temple.

**Themis Aftermath & Departures:**

* **Bront & Steros:** The famed Jancan blacksmith Bront was successfully rescued from the temple and reunited with his son Steros aboard the *Ultros*. They are now available to craft non-magical items for the party.  
* **Amazon Sisterhood:** Darien (Aella's cousin and rightful heir) and Makaira (the queen's attendant) remained on Themis to reorganize the Sisterhood, root out Lutheria's cult, and prepare for Aella's potential return as queen.  
* **Aella's Epic Path:** Aella must still slay the Great Roc of the Forgotten Sea and present its head to the Sisterhood to prove her divine right to rule and reclaim her throne.  
* **Party Level Up:** All party members gained a level for their heroic deeds.  
* **Astraeus's Character Sheet:** Astraeus confirmed changes to his character, accepting the level 8 update with a Constitution increase and a Charisma of 21\. He chose  
   *Polymorph* and *Dimension Door* as his two fourth-level spells, noting that *Dimension Door* would allow him to bring one other person with him.  
* **New Items:**  
  * **Rhaena:** Attuned to the *hovering chariot* heirloom, which provides significant buffs, including increased movement, advantage on initiative, extra force damage on charges, and benefits for a passenger (like disadvantage on attacks against them or advantage on concentration checks).  
  * **Aella:** Wields the *Oathkeeper Chakram*, a "deadly returning disc capable of unleashing a silent, vorpal path of destruction". She also plans to wear the  
     *Winged Sandals of the Harpy Queen*.  
  * **Titan's Bane (Blade of Talius):** The party successfully retrieved the legendary sword *Titan's Bane* from the hydra's stomach. It is a \+3 adamantine sword that deals \+1d6 necrotic damage, an additional \+3d6 necrotic damage against Titans and cyclopes, and casts  
     *dispel magic* when it hits a creature. It can change between a longsword, shortsword, or greatsword. Its adamantine nature allows it to deal double damage against objects and constructs, and it has advantage on saving throws against attempts to damage it. The sword has a subtle presence, like a voice in the wielder's mind. Rhaena cannot attune to it immediately due to other attuned items but noted the short rest attunement time.

**The Hydra Encounter:**

* The party sought the legendary sword from the temple's hydra.  
* Astraeus used  
   *Polymorph* to turn the 10-headed hydra into a giant toad, with the DM ruling that if the creature is killed while polymorphed, it reverts to its original form.  
* Aella attempted to retrieve the sword from the polymorphed toad's gullet, finally succeeding on her second attempt.

**Travel to Turtle Island:**

* The party decided to stop at Turtle Island on their way to the next destination to deliver the basilisk eye to Shazum.  
* Astraeus's attempt to use his harp to speed up travel failed, so the journey to Turtle Island (and then the Centaur constellation island) would take the full 3 days.  
* Upon arrival, they noted a new Mytrosian Royal Academy caravel, the  
   *Sage's Voyage*, docked there.

**Turtle Island (Jazirat Zulhaf) Interactions:**

* **Shazum:**  
  * Confirmed receipt of the Perfect Basilisk Eye, completing that quest.  
  * Reiterated the previous reward options: 750 gp, a  
     *bag of holding*, *cloak of protection*, *periapt of wound closure*, *Orb of Star Metal*, *Mithril Ingot*, *Vial of Gorgon Blood*, or *Dragon Scales*. The party clarified they had already received the  
     *Orb of Star Metal*.  
  * Gave a new quest: acquire an  
     *intact scorpion stinger and tail* from a giant scorpion.  
  * Rolled for new items in stock:  
     *Ring of Water Walking*, *Gloves of Dexterity*, and *Gauntlets of Hill Giant Strength*.  
  * Rolled for new ingredients:  
     *Elemental Mote*, *Golemstone*, and *Hydra Scales*. The party chose the  
     *Golemstone* as a reward.  
  * Had  
     *Potions of Growth* (1d3), *Potion of Fire Giant Strength*, *Potion of Frost Giant Strength*, and *Oil of Sharpness* in stock for purchase.  
  * **Unknown Potions:** He identified the mysterious red and blue potions from Themis as a type of enlarge/reduce potion with an additional, subtle side effect that he couldn't pinpoint, suggesting multiple doses might increase the effect.  
  * **Shimmering Pink Liquid:** He identified this as a *Potion of Chromatic Displacement*, allowing the user to become translucent, phase through solid objects for 10 feet of movement per turn (must end in unoccupied space), gain resistance to all damage except force and psychic, but lose phasing and gain disadvantage on stealth in bright light.  
* **The Floating Lantern (Tavern):**  
  * Run by Lyra Padma, a half-elf proprietor.  
  * Ordered a "Harpy Screech" (Astraeus) and a "Chaos Cocktail" (Delphi).  
  * *Harpy Screech* effect: Once per hour, action to shriek (15 ft radius, DC 13 Con save or deafened for 1 min); user becomes hoarse with disadvantage on Charisma checks for 1 hour.  
  * *Chaos Cocktail* effect: Roll a d6; Delphi rolled 5, causing him to "hiccup small harmless illusions for one hour".  
* **Elara Vancroft:**  
  * The party encountered Elara Vancroft, a researcher in "Astro-Geological History" from the Mytrosian Royal Academy, intensely studying maps and instruments in the tavern.  
  * She was initially annoyed by the interruption but became interested when the party identified themselves as adventurers with firsthand experience.  
  * She proposed trading information: their firsthand accounts for her research.  
  * The party confirmed Fire Island is the Constellation of the Prisoner (though she was unaware they destroyed a colony).  
  * Elara stated the Constellation of the Centaur leads to  
     *Scorpion Island* or *Indigo Island*.  
  * The party shared an Amazonian map, which she found fascinating and copied.  
  * Elara believes the Constellation of the Bard leads to the  
     *Isle of the Fates*.  
  * She confirmed the Constellation of the Gygan leads to the  
     *Island of Yonder* (Sydon's general Gaius's stronghold, where the missing Antikythera gear and Delphi's family armor are located).  
  * The party confirmed Themis is the Constellation of the Twins.

**Future Crafting:**

* The party inquired about enchanting a Mithril Chain Shirt into \+1 armor, which requires the Mithril Forge and ingredients like two Mithril Ingots and a Golemstone or Hydra Scales. They considered sending their flying construct, Caledony, with materials to the Mithril Forge. They will send the Golemstone they just received for this purpose.

**Next Destination:**

* The party is now sailing from Turtle Island to the island marked by the Constellation of the Centaur (either Scorpion Island or Indigo Island).

This session saw the successful conclusion of the Themis temple arc, the acquisition of powerful new magical items, a significant level-up, and key information gained about future destinations and their associated constellations. The path to reclaiming Aella's throne and facing the Titans is becoming clearer.

# Session 33 [Session 33](#session-33)

### **A Troubled Voyage: Lutheria's Nightmare**

As the *Ultros* sailed toward the island marked by the Constellation of the Centaur, the party was assailed by a shared, horrifying dream sent by the Titan, Lutheria. The vision depicted shipwrecked sailors succumbing to cannibalism on a desolate shore. The dream's potent magic overwhelmed both Astraeus and Delphi, who awoke consumed by a violent bloodlust, turning on their companions.

A chaotic struggle ensued below decks.
*   Aella and Rhaena, having resisted the dream's influence, fought to restrain their friends without causing serious harm.
*   Aella managed to grapple the frenzied Astraeus, while Rhaena attempted to subdue him with nets.
*   The conflict was resolved when Rhaena, having attuned to the recently acquired **Titan's Bane**, struck her companions with the flat of the adamantine blade. The sword's inherent *dispel magic* property successfully broke Lutheria's enchantment, first on Astraeus and then on Delphi, returning them to their senses.
*   In the aftermath, Delphi noted that he should consider attuning to the **Codex of Nocturnal Mysteries** before sleeping to gain its advantage on dream-related checks and prevent future mental assaults.

### **Arrival at Scorpion Island**

After three days at sea, the party arrived at a flat, arid island dominated by a single, ominous black tower at its center. An impressive History check from Astraeus confirmed this was **Scorpion Island**, a known proving ground for Aresian warriors due to its dangerous fauna.

The party moored the *Ultros* and took a rowboat to a shore marked by crumbling fortifications and beautiful, flowering trees. There, they encountered the very same Aresian warrior monks they had met on Turtle Island, led by Captain Galenus.

### **Counsel with the Monks of Aresia**

Galenus and his lieutenants confirmed the island's dark history:
*   The island's centaur tribe was cursed long ago by a powerful gynosphinx known as the **Lotus Witch**, who resides in the central tower.
*   The centaurs had destroyed a "living library" of knowledge carved into the island's trees, and as punishment, the witch cursed them to transform into monstrous giant scorpions upon reaching adulthood.
*   The Aresian monks use the island as a sacred trial ground, fighting the transformed centaurs to test their initiates and grant the cursed creatures a final peace.

The monks warned the party to avoid the Lotus Witch's tower, shared a simple meal with them, and asked them to check on their initiates, who were currently undergoing their trial inland. The party also confirmed their goal of acquiring a giant scorpion stinger and tail for the marid, Shazum.

### **Trial by Fire: The Scorpion's Oasis**

Following the path inland, the party was drawn by the sounds of battle to an ancient, scorpion-themed temple near an oasis. They discovered the Aresian initiates locked in a desperate fight against three **giant scorpions**, and they were losing badly.

The party charged into battle to aid the young warriors.
*   Aella used the silent path of her **Oathkeeper Chakram** to strike all three scorpions in a single devastating attack.
*   The combined might of the party and the remaining monks quickly dispatched two of the scorpions.
*   The largest of the creatures, a **Gargantuan Scorpion**, proved more resilient, grappling and killing one of the initiates before the party could intervene.
*   As the battle raged, the ground began to vibrate, heralding a new threat.

### **Session End & Next Steps**

The session ended on a cliffhanger. As the party fought the Gargantuan Scorpion, a new, even more terrifying creature crested a nearby sand dune: a colossal **Scorpion Matriarch**, covered in swarming baby scorpions, joining the fray to defend her brood.

The party will begin the next session in the middle of this dangerous encounter. Once the island's business is concluded, they have discussed traveling to the **Isle of the Fates**, guided by the Constellation of the Bard, to pursue Astraeus's epic path.

# Session 34 [Session 34](#session-34)

*   **Scorpion Battle Commencement:**
    *   The session began with the party facing three normal giant scorpions and the massive Scorpion Matriarch, alongside the Aresian warrior monks.
    *   Aella took flight, engaging the Matriarch and successfully landing two powerful chakram strikes, dealing significant damage.
    *   The remaining Aresian monks attacked another large scorpion, managing to knock it prone before being wiped out by a poison spray attack from a different scorpion, which killed all five.

*   **Astraeus's gambit:**
    *   Astraeus cast *Hypnotic Pattern*, successfully incapacitating one of the large scorpions.

*   **Centaurs' Arrival:**
    *   Just as the battle turned grim, Nessa and her band of twelve centaurs charged over the dunes to join the fight against the scorpions.
    *   The centaurs effectively turned the tide, working with the party to defeat the remaining scorpions and the Matriarch.

*   **Post-Battle Introductions & Lore:**
    *   Nessa introduced herself and her tribe, explaining they were cursed by the Lotus Witch.
    *   She revealed that all centaurs on the island transform into scorpions upon reaching adulthood. The only escape is to form a sacred bond with a mortal partner and leave the island.
    *   The party learned that the Lotus Witch, a powerful gynosphinx, resides in the central tower.

*   **The Flower Field and the Tower:**
    *   The centaurs led the party to the edge of a field of beautiful yellow wildflowers surrounding the tower.
    *   They warned that the field is enchanted and distorts time, making it impossible to cross safely. Flying over it is also deadly, as it triggers lightning storms.

*   **Testing the Field:**
    *   The party conducted several experiments to understand the field's properties:
        *   **Firebolt:** A *Firebolt* fizzled out, aging rapidly and disappearing before hitting anything.
        *   **Thrown Rock:** A thrown rock aged, weathered, and turned to dust mid-air.
        *   **Scorpion Carcass:** A dead scorpion's carcass was thrown in and rapidly decayed to bone before vanishing.
        *   **Live Scorpion:** A captured live scorpion was thrown in and experienced horrifying, rapid cycles of aging, transformation, and death before disintegrating.
        *   **Familiar:** A familiar sent through the field was destroyed, its spiritual connection violently severed.

*   **Conclusion of the Session:**
    *   The party, having exhausted their immediate ideas for bypassing the field, took a long rest with the centaurs to prepare for their next attempt to reach the tower.

    Here is a detailed log of the session's events, formatted for your quest log:

# Session 35 [Session 35](#session-35)
## The Tower of the Lotus Witch

* **Breaching the Barrier:** After discussing the dangers of the time-distorting field around the tower, the party decided to send one person in first to test it. [cite: 130, 131]
* **Delphi's Gamble:** Delphi volunteered to enter the field. [cite: 132] He cast *Bless* on himself, Aella, and Astraeus, and tied a rope around his waist for the party to hold. [cite: 133, 135, 136] Astraeus also granted him Bardic Inspiration. [cite: 137, 139]
* **A World Unmoored:** Upon stepping into the field, Delphi witnessed time become unmoored, with the sun and stars wheeling madly across the sky from the wrong horizons. [cite: 144, 145] A door became visible in the side of the once-seamless tower. [cite: 147] To the rest of the party, Delphi appeared to be in a state of superposition before vanishing entirely. [cite: 148, 159, 160]
* **Reunification:** After briefly exiting the field to find his companions gone, Delphi re-entered. [cite: 161, 166, 175] Aella and Astraeus, seeing him at the tower door, followed him into the temporal field and the party was reunited. [cite: 186, 188, 191, 194]
* **The Lost Children:** The party entered the tower, finding a large chamber inhabited by dozens of children of various races. [cite: 200, 202, 203] These children were revealed to be former adventurers, de-aged by the Lotus Witch. [cite: 206, 208, 244, 254, 255]
* **A Warning Given:** A young boy named Leander and other children warned the party that they should not have come and urged them to visit the "flower lady" at the top of the tower immediately to show proper respect. [cite: 233, 235, 242, 247] They advised the party to be honest and knowledgeable about Thylea's history, as the witch asks questions about the old times. [cite: 250, 251, 252]
* **The Tower's Secrets:** The party ascended the long, spiraling staircase, passing through several chambers:
    * A museum containing preserved specimens, most notably the skeletal remains of a six-armed Gigan in ancient bronze armor. [cite: 301, 317, 318, 319]
    * A portal chamber dominated by a massive, intricate summoning circle and braziers burning with magical flames. [cite: 331, 332, 341]
    * A room with multiple windows looking out into other planes of existence, including a hellscape, a heavenly plane, the Astral Plane, and a strange twilight world with a crystalline city. [cite: 351, 355, 357, 358, 359, 367, 368] One window, sealed with glass, looked down upon Scorpion Island from miles above. [cite: 360, 361, 363]
* **The Sphinx's Lair:** At the summit, the party entered a vast chamber and came face-to-face with the Lotus Witch, a majestic gynosphinx. [cite: 382, 388]
* **A Test of Knowledge:** Intrigued by the party's quest and the presence of a Dragonlord (Delphi), the Sphinx agreed to share her knowledge if they could first prove their wisdom. [cite: 398, 409] They must correctly answer three of her four questions about the history of Thylea. [cite: 414, 415] Failure means joining the "nursery" of children below. [cite: 416]
* **Question 1 - The Cruelest Lord:** The Sphinx asked, "Who was the cruelest of the Dragonlords?" [cite: 493]
    * **Answer:** The party correctly identified **Estor Arkelander**. [cite: 494, 510] The Sphinx confirmed this was correct. [cite: 511]
* **Question 2 - The First Lord:** The Sphinx asked, "Who was the first of the Dragonlords?" [cite: 511]
    * **Answer:** After deliberation, the party correctly identified **Xander**. [cite: 625, 626] The Sphinx confirmed this was also correct, adding that she knew him personally. [cite: 631, 632]
* **Question 3 - The Twin Titans:** The Sphinx asked, "When Thylea bore fruit, which two Titans sprang forth from a single pit?" [cite: 635]
    * **Status:** The party debated the answer, with different members suspecting different pairs of Titans. The session concluded before a final answer was given to the Sphinx. [cite: 636, 655, 657, 672]
