# Player Characters

This directory is for storing information about the Player Characters (PCs).

Create a markdown file for each character (e.g., `gimli.md`, `legolas.md`). You can include details like:

*   Backstory
*   Goals and motivations
*   Important relationships
*   A picture of the character (you can link to it)
