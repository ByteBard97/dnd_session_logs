# Session 5 Recap: The Engineer's Gambit and the Silent Turbine

When last we left our ruthless agents of House T'alzar, you were masters of a silent fortress. The sub-level was yours, its former guardians silenced and stacked in closets. But your path forward was blocked by a colossal, roaring turbine, a spinning wall of steel between you and your brother, **Valandor**.

Your next move was a study in brutal efficiency. You targeted the Gear Room, the control hub for the deadly machine. Ravi, cloaked in the guise of the slain Chief Researcher, and Malagar, disguised as a common guard, confronted the lone worker inside. Through clever deception, you learned the secrets of the levers—how to divert the steam, and more importantly, how to trigger a full system shutdown. The worker, having outlived his usefulness, was executed with cold precision, his body added to the growing pile.

With the controls understood, you set your sights on a greater prize: **Chief Engineer Tholdrum**, who you believed held one of the three keys to Valandor’s prison. What followed was a synchronized breach plan. From the catwalks above, Malagar and Zyntra prepared to rain death from above with grenades, while the rest of you prepared to storm the doors.

But no plan survives contact with the enemy—or a clumsy ally. Clank, misreading a cue, burst through the door prematurely, and the room exploded into chaos. Grenades fell, blasting Tholdrum's sentries to pieces and sending the Chief Engineer himself sprawling. You descended upon him, a whirlwind of steel and magic. But Tholdrum was no simple overseer. Enraged, he overcharged his massive steam hammer and, in a single, furious assault, crushed Ravi, leaving him on the brink of death.

It was a desperate fight. But after a quick heal from Haribo, you rallied. Malagar, a blur of motion, unleashed a relentless series of strikes, finally silencing the Chief Engineer in a fountain of his own blood.

You plundered his corpse, claiming his magical armor and a host of strange alchemical potions. But you also made a devastating discovery: Tholdrum did not have the key. The rod you seek is still out of reach.

And so we find you now, standing before the controls of the silent turbine. You have the power to shut it down completely, to create a path forward. But doing so will sound a foundry-wide alarm, bringing the full weight of the duergar down upon you in minutes. You face a terrible choice: Do you risk the shutdown, creating a desperate race against time? Or do you find another, more subtle way to weaponize the very machine that blocks your path? The silence of the sub-level is yours, but time is running out.

# Session 4 Player Recap: The Silence and the Slaughter

When last we left our ruthless agents of House T'alzar, you had drawn first blood in the Cinderfork Foundry, silencing the researchers in their own home. But the sub-level was far from secure, its halls still echoing with the clang of machinery and the tread of duergar boots. What followed was not a battle, but a systematic, chilling purge.

Your cottage became a slaughterhouse disguised as a sanctuary. One by one, you lured the foundry's personnel to their doom. First, the unsuspecting guard, **Borland Emberback**, drawn in by Bentham's flawless imitation of the now-dead Alyxina crying "fire!" He walked into a dark kitchen and was met not with smoke, but with a waiting storm of steel. His death was swift, his keys now yours.

With calculated precision, you turned this trick into a gruesome production line. Rav'ithar, cloaked in the shadow of the fallen guard, became the new gatekeeper. He beckoned another worker, **Heldrick**, with promises of a secret stash of rum, leading him into the same fatal ambush. Then came the formidable **Stone Guard, Corgrim Smelt-Eye**, a warrior lured to his death by the lie that his subordinates were slacking off inside. He, too, fell to your coordinated assault.

Your quiet butchery was nearly exposed by the arrival of **"Peepers,"** the foundry's all-seeing Scrutinizer. As the construct floated towards the cottage, its alarm ready to sound, you sprung a new trap. A globe of absolute silence enveloped the cottage, swallowing all sound. As the machine entered the unnatural quiet, the very ground erupted in grasping vines, entangling and holding it fast. You descended upon the helpless machine, tearing it apart and ensuring your infiltration remained a secret.

With the ground floor secured, knowledge became your weapon. Rav'ithar, having consumed the researcher Korvun's memories, saw the foundry's inner workings laid bare in his mind. He now understood the layout, the chain of command, and the agonizing secret at the facility's heart: a mighty **Geothermal Elemental**, caged and tormented to power the forges.

Assuming the forms of your victims, you ascended to the mezzanine, a catwalk overlooking the foundry floor. You became ghosts in the machine, your disguises perfect, your purpose lethal. An officious **inspector named Kelzar** was the first to fall, tricked into a secluded stairwell where his authority meant nothing against your blades. His own workers were sent to their deaths moments later, commanded to "assist" his corpse. One by one, you cleared the upper level, tricking and executing the remaining duergar hammerers, your movements a ballet of deception and death. The bodies piled up, hidden away in the dark, as you looted the workshops, claiming valuable crystals and unrefined mithril, the very substance you came for.

Your only wild card came in the form of **Og**, a hulking Quaggoth who approached the guard post seeking a salve for a chemical burn. Bentham, still playing the role of the guard, masterfully deflected the beast's questions, sending him away confused but alive, your cover intact.

And so, we find you now, masters of a silent fortress. The entire sub-level and its overlooking mezzanine are under your control, the bodies of your enemies stuffed into closets and crates. You stand in the heart of the enemy's operation, a mountain of corpses behind you and a wealth of intelligence in your hands. But your path forward is blocked by a colossal, roaring turbine, spinning with deadly speed. Before you lies a choice: do you risk manipulating the complex machinery to grant you passage, or do you dare to unleash the raging, imprisoned elemental and ride the wave of chaos that follows? The foundry is quiet for now, but the silence is yours, and it is waiting to be broken. 

# Session 3

### **The Black Loch Crossing & A Glimmer of Hope**

Last we left our drow operatives, the lights of Vlyn'darastyl were fading behind you as the *Silent Keel* cut through the inky waters of the Black Loch. Borok the Silent, the grim orog ferryman, steered with an unspoken authority, his grip tight on his axe-shaped tiller. Fadda Brinebless, the chattering goblin priest, sprinkled sacred loch water, whispering blessings for a safe passage. The monstrous Keelhauler eels, tethered to the skiff, pulled with eerie quietness, their blind white eyes occasionally glinting in the dim light.

Your journey through the abyssal depths proved as perilous as prophesied. First, the *Silent Keel* was forced to navigate around treacherous **hydrothermal vents**, plumes of superheated steam rising from the water, hinting at the duergar patrols that favored their warmth. Later, a chilling spectral sight emerged from the gloom: a **Ghost Barge**, its translucent timbers and silent, toiling figures a grim omen of unending labor. You watched it pass, a stark reminder of the Underdark's cruelties.

Then, a profound stillness descended upon the loch, and a sickly green glow pulsed from the depths – the **Whisperer's Omen**. Fadda, trembling with terror, implored your aid in a desperate ritual. Through combined efforts, channeling arcane energy, steadying the vessel, and offering symbolic sacrifices, you managed to calm the restless entity, earning a rare, approving grunt from Borok himself.

### **The Cinderfork Sub-Level: Discovery and Bloodshed**

As you neared Cinderfork Foundry, its fiery glow stained the water ahead, and the bone-deep thrum of its machinery resonated through the very rock. Your infiltration plan, a daring underwater approach, was initiated. Haribo, shrouded in invisibility and transformed into a bat, scouted ahead.

Your aerial reconnaissance revealed the grim heart of duergar industry. At the docks, you saw a slow duergar barge, a drow yacht, and, ominously, **Valandor's own speedboat, the *Night-Talon***. Inside the foundry's main level, you glimpsed off-duty workers and, more disturbing, the gruesome assembly of **Screamers**, with duergar being forced into metallic suits by a grim priest and master smith. You even overheard workers grumbling about Valandor, referring to him as "the drow prisoner, the artificer," and hinting that "they finally broke the prisoner today". The Peepers, the foundry's anti-invisibility constructs, also lurked, a threat to your stealth.

Descending to the moonpool, you surfaced in a warm, humid cavern, the thrumming of the massive turbine deafening. Your first target: a deceptively cozy cottage on the sub-level. Bentham, still in his natural form, led the way, ambushing **Alyxina Fire-Beard**, the researcher's wife, as she cooked. After a brief interrogation, Malagar, with brutal efficiency, **slit her throat**, and Bentham dragged the body into a nearby storage room, which was then looted for supplies and spare parts. Haribo, meanwhile, befriended Alyxina's pet cave spider, Skitter, by offering it fresh rat blood.

Next, you moved to the upper level of the cottage, where **Chief Researcher Korvun** worked in his study. Bentham, now shape-shifted into Alyxina's form, attempted a deception, introducing the party as "college friends". Though Korvun was suspicious, the ruse held long enough for the ambush. Ramon paralyzed him with *Hold Person*, and Haribo poisoned him with spores. While Zyntra accidentally triggered an alarm by failing to disarm a trap on a locked chest, Korvun, under duress, finally revealed the location of Valandor: imprisoned upstairs, behind a heavy **adamantine door** requiring special "rods of unlocking" held by the three foundry bosses. As the information was extracted, Zyntra disarmed the alarm and the chest's gas trap. With a final, chilling act, Bentham **executed Korvun**, delivering a parting taunt about his murdered wife.

From Korvun's hidden chest, you secured invaluable finds: three **Dûmril Ingots** (Black Mithril) stamped with the ancient Auldbaern symbol, proving their origin in the royal catacombs; a **Prototype Resonance Lens**, capable of detecting thoughts; and a damning letter from **Director Koldar** (sealed with House Glutthraz wax) demanding increased Screamer output, confirming your rivals' deep involvement. You also found a manual on "Transmutation" and a note hinting at the "Deep-Spire map" for the true source of Dûmril.

With Korvun and Alyxina silenced, the truth of Valandor's fate is clearer than ever: he is alive, albeit imprisoned, and his research is central to the horrific Screamer project. You now possess the means to potentially stop this grim production, armed with critical intelligence and samples of the very Black Mithril that fuels the duergar's monstrous creations. The stage is set for the next phase of your infiltration, with Valandor's rescue, and vengeance, within your grasp.

# Session 2

Welcome back to the Underdark. When last we left our heroes, you had been entrusted with the most critical mission your house has ever faced.

### **The Price of Failure**

You stood in a makeshift war room before your Matron Mother, Severine T'alzar. She spoke with the cold precision of a chess master, but with the barely concealed strain of a mother on the edge of a precipice. Her son, your brother Valandor, was missing—his research into a revolutionary alloy called "Black Mithril" had led him to the Duergar of Cinderfork Foundry, and he had not returned . Your orders were clear: infiltrate the foundry, find Valandor, and Rescue him at any cost. Failure, she made clear, was not an option.

The weight of this mission was made heartbreakingly real when the doors burst open and in rushed Miraleth, Valandor's young daughter. Clutching a broken clockwork spider, she spoke of a terrible dream—of fire, hammers, and her father calling for help. You promised her you would bring him home, a vow that now hangs over your journey.

### **The Workshop of Secrets**

Guided by your sister, the spymaster Lirael, you made your way to Valandor's secret workshop to retrieve a powerful siege drill for the mission. After bypassing the guardian construct "Nugget," you discovered the strange wonders within. You found Valandor's "Oculo-Metalloscope," learning that his research into Black Mithril was tied to the ancient "Catacombs of Aldebaran," the dwarven ruins upon which your very city was built.

More unsettling was the creature in the massive vat: a telepathic Underdark shark named "Teeth in Dark," an agitated test subject for Valandor's experiments. While the others investigated, Malagar ventured to the market, returning with a bounty of fresh fish. You fed the lonely, hungry predator, calming it and forging an unexpected bond of trust .

### **A Procession of Lies**

With the massive drill needing transport, Lirael devised a cunning plan. Using her magic, she cloaked the machine in an illusion, transforming it into a grand, obsidian statue of the goddess Lolth. You and your companions became somber temple attendants, forming a religious procession to move through the city unnoticed.

Your deception was tested twice. First, by a drunken noble who you expertly intimidated into leaving your "holy relic" alone . Next, you were accosted by the "Rust Rats," a vicious street gang demanding a toll . Reading their leader's mind and choosing discretion over violence, you paid the bribe, ensuring your cover remained intact as you continued your silent march through the city's dark streets.

### **The Ferrymen**

You finally arrived at a forgotten wharf on the edge of the city. There, your transport awaited: a low skiff captained by the grim Orog, Borok the Silent, and his chattering goblin priest, Fadda Brinebless . Lirael dropped the illusion, wished you luck, and melted back into the shadows, leaving you to your fate. After loading the drill, you boarded the vessel, which is pulled not by oars or sail, but by two monstrous, chained Keelhauler eels.

And that is where we find you now. On a boat captained by a silent brute, pulled by monsters across the vast, dark waters of the Black Loch. The lights of Vlyn'darastyl fade behind you, and ahead lies only darkness, and the smoke and fire of Cinderfork Foundry. Your mission has truly begun.

# Session 1

---

### **Previously, on Lost Mine of the Drow...**

We began in the oppressive darkness of Vlyn'darastyl, a city of treacherous light and shadow. You are the sworn agents of

**House T'alzar**, a noble family of unparalleled artificers, whose legacy is being bled dry by the silent, economic war waged by your rivals, House Glutthraz. Your only hope lies with your brother,

**Valandor**, who is on a desperate mission to the Cinderfork Foundry to unlock the secrets of a legendary alloy that could save you all.

Your story began with a summons from your sister, the devout and fearsome

**Vyssinia**, to the fighting pits for a "practice session". But this was to be no simple sparring match. Before the analytical eyes of your other sister, the spymaster

**Lirael**, Vyssinia declared that true devotion to the Spider Queen must be proven through trial and sacrifice. With a sharp command, the gates were opened, and a nightmare of chitin and madness was unleashed upon you—a

**Drider**.

The battle that followed was a clash of wills as much as blades. As you fought for your lives, you were caught between your two sisters' warring philosophies.

From the gallery above, Vyssinia’s voice rang out, a torrent of zealous fervor, urging you to embrace the glory of combat. When you were struck, she declared it a gift from Lolth. "Pain is Lolth's gift\! Let it sharpen your hatred\!" she cried. When you dealt a blow, she roared her approval: "Yes\! Let its blood paint the sacred sand\!".

Meanwhile, Lirael’s voice cut through the chaos with cool, tactical precision. She offered you insights and bardic inspiration, chiding you when you faltered. "Predictable attack pattern. Adjust your defense\!" she would snap, before granting you the edge you needed to survive.

In the end, it was **Bentham** who delivered the final, fatal strike, felling the monstrous creature. As a reward for this display of brutal efficiency, Vyssinia presented you with a prize from her personal collection: the coveted

**Amulet of Misty Step**.

The fight was over, but the conflict had just begun. The sisters descended and argued over the bloody spectacle. Vyssinia praised your violence as a holy sacrifice that would win the Spider Queen's favor. But Lirael revealed the truth: the Drider was a captured spy, an intelligence asset you had been forced to destroy, squandering a chance to learn more about your enemies' plans.

In the anxious days that followed, the mood in the tower grew heavy. Valandor was now officially late, and a palpable worry crept through the halls. Finally, the summons came—not to the fighting pits, but to the grand ballroom, which had been stripped of its finery and converted into a war room.

There, before maps of the Black Loch and strange arcane devices, stood your **Matron Mother, Severine T'alzar**. With a voice like compressed steel, she delivered the dire news: Valandor was missing. All contact was lost. This was no longer a matter of waiting for good news. This was a **rescue mission**.

And that is where we find you now. Your Matron has laid out the plans, three desperate paths into the heart of an enemy fortress. The life of your brother and the very future of House T'alzar hang in the balance, and the choice of how to proceed is yours.
