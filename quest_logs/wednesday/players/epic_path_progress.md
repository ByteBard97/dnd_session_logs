### **Zephyrion, The Demi-God**

*   **Your Goal**: You are the son of Pythor, God of Battle. Your destiny is to rise above your father's despair, prove your worth through great deeds, and forge a divine weapon to claim your place in the pantheon.
*   **Where You Are Now**: You have met your father, who, in a moment of clarity, entrusted you with his legendary hammer. You have journeyed to the Mithral Forge and, with your companions, braved its depths to relight its fires. The forge gods are ready to begin their work on your divine weapon, the **Rod of Lordly Might**.
*   **What's Next**: Volkan and Pyra are researching the legendary components required to complete the weapon. You expect a message from them soon—likely via their newly repaired Calydonian messenger—detailing the perilous quest you must undertake to gather these materials.

### **Tharok, The Cursed One**

*   **Your Goal**: A curse laid by the Titans has plagued your bloodline for generations. You must seek a way to break it, not only for yourself but for the survival of your family.
*   **Where You Are Now**: The ancient lich, Damon, recognized the curse's origin and set you on the correct path. He confirmed the curse was devised by the Titans themselves and gave you a lost family heirloom, a *Gem of Brightness*. Most importantly, he directed you to seek the counsel of the enigmatic Lotus Witch on Scorpion Island.
*   **What's Next**: Your moment is at hand. With the *Ultros* now under your party's command, you have set your course for Scorpion Island. The confrontation with the Lotus Witch—and the secrets she holds—is your immediate future.

### **Kain, The Dragonslayer**

*   **Your Goal**: You are fated to become the bane of dragons, destined to confront the one who destroyed your past. To do so, you must find a weapon of legendary power.
*   **Where You Are Now**: Your journey has led you to the re-lit Mithral Forge, where you met the ancient Forgekeeper. While you have acquired a powerful new bow from the broodmother's lair, the smith-god Volkan has given you a more specific lead: a scholar named Chondrus, on the dangerous, Sydon-controlled Isle of Yonder, is said to collect the very Gygan-forged artifacts you seek.
*   **What's Next**: Your path points to the Isle of Yonder. You must find a way to reach this treacherous island and confront the scholar Chondrus to acquire a weapon powerful enough to take your revenge on Helios, the dragon who destroyed your home.

### **Nikandros, The Lost One**

*   **Your Goal**: You are a traveler from a world beyond Thylea. To find your way home, the Oracle has told you that you must first find the lost treasure of the Dragonlords.
*   **Where You Are Now**: You have achieved a monumental step in your quest. After a harrowing series of battles, you and your companions have defeated the ghost captain Estor Arkelander and claimed his legendary ship, the *Ultros*. According to legend, Estor knew the location of the treasure.
*   **What's Next**: Estor is gone, but you have made allies of his former thanes, Metron and Davos, and earned the loyalty of the spectral crew. They may hold the secrets that died with their captain. Your next step is to question the crew about the location of the Dragonlords' treasure, which is said to be hidden somewhere in the perilous Nether Sea.

### **Andrew Lynx, The Patron's Agent**

*   **Your Goal**: You serve an ancient and powerful entity that exists outside the normal flow of time. It has shown you glimpses of a terrible future, a cataclysm that threatens to consume Thylea *after* the reign of the Titans is over. You must interpret your patron's cryptic warnings and guide your companions to prevent this future from coming to pass.
*   **Where You Are Now**: Your path is one of secrets and riddles. The voice in your dreams speaks of a "Great Convergence"—a pivotal moment that will determine the world's ultimate fate. While your allies fight the gods and monsters before them, you must look for the threads of destiny that others cannot see.
*   **What's Next**: Your patron urges you to seek a place hidden from mortal maps, a sanctuary where time itself is woven. You must convince your allies to trust your visions and embark on a journey to this mysterious location, for it is only there that you can receive the answers needed to avert the coming doom.

### **Rhy-At, The Broken One**

*   **Your Goal**: Rebuilt by Volkan after your death, you are incomplete. To restore your mind and soul, you must find the **Mind Diamond** and the **Soul Emerald**, gems containing your lost memories and identity.
*   **Where You Are Now**: You have made contact with your creator, Volkan, at the newly-rekindled Mithral Forge. He now has the resources to begin scrying for your missing components, which were stolen by agents of the Titan Lutheria.
*   **What's Next**: Volkan is actively working to pinpoint the locations of the Mind Diamond and the Soul Emerald. He has promised to dispatch the Calydonian messenger with his findings as soon as he has a solid lead for you to pursue. Your task is to be ready when the message arrives.
