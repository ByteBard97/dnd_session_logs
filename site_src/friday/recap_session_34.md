# Session 34

## The Scourge & The Sundial

When last we left our heroes, they stood on the sun-scorched plains of Scorpion Island, locked in a desperate battle for survival. The sands were stained with the blood of the fallen Aresian monks, and before you stood a terrifying host of giant scorpions, led by a monstrous, building-sized Matriarch.

The air filled with the sickening crunch of chitin and the screams of the dying. Aella, a blur of motion in the sky, unleashed her chakram in a devastating arc, while Astraeus's quick thinking with a *Hypnotic Pattern* took one of the giant beasts out of the fight. But the odds were grim. The last of the Aresian warriors were wiped out by a spray of venom, and the Matriarch loomed, a promise of certain death.

Just as all hope seemed lost, a new sound cut through the chaos—not the chittering of scorpions, but the thunder of galloping hooves. Over the dunes charged a dozen proud centaurs, their leader Nessa crying a challenge as they crashed into the scorpion lines! With the aid of these unexpected allies, the tide of battle turned. Working in concert, you and the centaurs brought down the remaining scorpions, felling the monstrous Matriarch in a final, bloody onslaught.

In the quiet aftermath, you learned the tragic truth of your new allies. Nessa explained the ancient curse laid upon her people by the Lotus Witch: every centaur on the island is doomed to transform into a monstrous scorpion upon reaching adulthood. Their only escape is to form a sacred bond with a mortal partner and flee the island forever.

The centaurs led you toward the source of their curse—a single, seamless black tower at the island's heart, surrounded by a breathtakingly beautiful field of golden wildflowers. But this beauty concealed a deadly secret. The centaurs warned you that the field was enchanted, a place where time itself is broken.

Your attempts to test this barrier only confirmed its terrifying nature. A *firebolt* aged into nothingness before it could strike. A thrown rock weathered and crumbled to dust in mid-air. A dead scorpion's carcass decayed to bone and then to nothing in seconds. Most horrifically, a dead scorpion carcass, hurled into the field, experienced a grotesque, rapid cycle , death, and monstrous transformation before disintegrating completely. Finally, sending a familiar through proved disastrous, the magical connection violently severed.

And so, our session ended.  having taken a long rest, gazing at the impossible field. The Lotus Witch waits within her silent, seamless spire, and the fate of an entire people rests on your ability to break through a barrier of time itself. What will you do?
