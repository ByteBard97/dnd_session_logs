# Session 1 {#session-1}

* 1\. The Summons at The Sour Vintage Inn  
  * Keerah's Summons: We were summoned to The Sour Vintage Inn, located twenty miles east of Estoria. Keerah, a renowned poet, revealed herself to be an agent of the Oracle. She informed us of our great destiny and tasked us with hunting a corrupted giant boar, unleashed by the Titans, Sydon and Lutheria, to terrorize the Heartlands.  
  * The Task: Keerah explained that the boar was a symbol of the weakening Oath of Peace, which once protected the mortals of Thylea from the wrath of the Titans. This boar had already slain many, and Keerah urged us to prove ourselves as the heroes of prophecy by slaying the beast.  
* 2\. The Hunt for the Corrupted Boar  
  * Journey into the Heartlands: We set off at dawn, guided by two scouts, Taneias and Javon. The morning was cold and foggy as we ventured northward, passing ravaged farms and gouged treesâ€”grim signs of the boar's rampage.  
  * The Battle: We tracked the boar to its lair, a cave strewn with the remains of its victims. The beast ambushed us, and in the ensuing battle, one of our scouts, Taneias, was tragically slain.   
  * Aella launched her mighty chakram at the beast, slitting its throat and laying it low. We emerged victorious, slaying the corrupted boar.  
  * The Boar's Prophecy: Before it died, the boar spoke to us in our minds, warning of an ancient power that sleeps in Thylea and prophesying doom and darkness for all mortal things. It claimed that no prophecy would save us from this fate.  
* 3\. The Sacrifice and Return to The Sour Vintage  
  * Honoring Pythor: Following Aella's advice, we burned the remains of the boar as a sacrificial offering to Pythor, the god of battle. In doing so, we hoped to honor him and gain his favor in the battles to come.   
  * Aella intuits the favor of Pythor, god of Battle.  
  * We recover some treasure and a magical silver spear, which is held by Rheana.  
  * Return to The Sour Vintage: We returned to The Sour Vintage Inn as heroes. The townsfolk greeted us with cheers and gratitude for freeing them from the terror of the boar. We spent the evening resting and reflecting on the day's events.  
  * Astreaus played an amazing performance regaling the audience with tales and song of our mighty deeds. He made a lot of gold in the process.  
* Level up to 2  
* 4\. The Oracle's Prophecy  
  * The Next Step: The following day, Kyrah reminded us of the importance of visiting the Oracle at her temple to the east. She believes that the Oracle, Versi, will reveal the next steps in our journey and provide us with guidance on how to avert the coming catastrophe.  
  * Journey to the Temple: We set off through the wilderness, leaving behind the comfort of The Sour Vintage and traveling through the Heartlands toward the temple. The journey took us nearly a day, and we arrived at the temple, ready to learn what the Oracle has foreseen.  
* 5\. Entering the Temple  
  * Aella was burned by the steam as she lunged forth through the geysers  
  * There are dangerous looking soldiers up ahead who wear the garb of Sydon
