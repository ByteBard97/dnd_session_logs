# Session 23

**Quest Log Update: Voyage to Fire Island & First Contact**

* **Departure & Voyage:** Set sail from Mitros aboard the *Ultros*, guided by the Antikythera calibrated to the constellation of the Prisoner, destination Fire Island. The primary goal is to locate a brass dragon egg mentioned by Versi. During the three-day voyage:  
  * Delphi spent time scribing spell scrolls.  
  * Astreus attempted to use his harp to influence the weather and speed the journey but was unsuccessful this time. He utilized two days of downtime to craft 2 Potions of Healing.  
  * The clockwork Caledony delivered the repaired *Axe of Xander* and the *Shield of Volkan* to the ship. No further crafting instructions were given.  
*   
* **Encounter: Jazirat Zulhaf (The Island Turtle):** On the second day of travel, encountered an uncharted island. Took the dinghy ashore (Astraeus, Delphi, Aella, Rhaena, Kyra) to investigate.  
  * **Discovery:** The island sits unusually high on warm stones. Docked vessels included Aresian ships (identified by Delphi via their wolf emblem).  
  * **Maelon (Triton Guardian):** Met at a shrine. Maelon revealed the island is a massive, living turtle, a mobile sanctuary. He confirmed it offers protection from nightmares, specifically mentioning Lutheria's influence. Directed the party to other inhabitants.  
  * **Shazum (Marid Trader):** Encountered in his trading post. Learned the island's name, Jazirat Zulhaf, and that it can be found again by navigating using the "Najma Zulhaf" (Turtle Star). It can be visited between other voyages without extra travel time. Received a quest: Retrieve **fire snake eggs** from Fire Island for Shazum in exchange for a choice of rare materials (Orb of Star Metal, Mithral Ingot, Vial of Gorgon Blood, or Dragon Scales). Shazum's current special inventory was limited (Potion of Heroism). Heard rumors about the Four Winds musicians and Commander Gaius on Yonder.  
  * **Aresian Warriors:** Briefly interacted with warriors led by Captain Galenus. Confirmed they are from Aresia, seeking rare goods/texts. Shared rumors concerning the Myrmekes' reef at Titan's Folly and the Queen of Themis.  
  * **Sea Elves (Lissandra & Kahlir):** Met the two sea elves monitoring unusual ocean currents with strange instruments. They requested the party report any observed anomalies during their travels. Shared a rumor about chimeras near Chimera Island.  
  * **Lyra Padma (Innkeeper):** Visited the "Floating Lantern" inn. Sampled "Tide Whisperer" brew (granted temporary Aquan understanding and perception of faint oceanic whispers). Stayed overnight, receiving protection from nightmares, 10 temporary HP, and 24 hours of psychic damage resistance.  
*   
* **Arrival at Fire Island:** Departed Jazirat Zulhaf on Sunday morning. Arrived at Fire Island after 8 hours. Anchored the *Ultros* and took the dinghy ashore onto a volcanic beach. The island features dense jungle, a central active volcano emitting smoke, and the smell of sulfur.  
* **First Contact (Bloodscale Tribe):** Met on the beach by Sessith, a shaman from the Bloodscale lizardfolk tribe, accompanied by warriors. Sessith indicated Queen Vytha was expecting the party and requested they follow him.  
* **Jungle Ambush & Rescue:** Followed Sessith through difficult jungle terrain. Discovered Firewalker lizardfolk interrogating a bound blue-scaled lizardfolk prisoner (Ssythra, their tribe's Keeper of Histories) while menacing her with a fire snake. A Terrorsaur scout was spotted circling overhead.  
  * **Combat:** Agreed to help Sessith ambush the Firewalkers. Aella cast *Pass Without Trace*; Delphi cast *Bless*. Aella initiated combat with a surprise Chakram Technique attack (boosted by Astreus's Bardic Inspiration), hitting the leader and ricocheting to severely wound/kill the skirmishers and the fire snake. The leader used stealth to disappear. Delphi finished off the remaining wounded skirmishers with magic. The Terrorsaur fled.  
  * **Aftermath:** Freed Ssythra. She confirmed the attackers were Firewalkers allied with Sidon. She possesses knowledge regarding the brass dragon eggs (one hatched into King Jankor's pet Wyrmling, others may remain) and the location of fire snake nests. Agreed to guide the party to Queen Vytha.  
*   
* **Bloodscale Village & Audience with Queen Vytha:** Traveled further through the jungle to the Bloodscale settlement (huts on platforms over water, central ziggurat). Met Queen Vytha on the central platform.  
  * **Negotiation:** Vytha acknowledged prophecies foretelling their arrival and the conflict with King Jankor, who controls the volcano and serves Sydon. She requested the party's aid in defeating Jankor.  
  * **Offer & Dilemma:** In return for assistance, Vytha offered knowledge of the dragon eggs' location and a secret path into Jankor's volcano fortress. She then proposed a celebratory feast to seal the alliance, revealing the tribe's highest honor: the ritual sacrifice and consumption of her son (Karth/Skreel) to grant strength to the warriors, including the party. The son appeared solemnly ready to accept this fate. The session ended awaiting the party's response to this proposal.

**Current Objectives on Fire Island:**

* Respond to Queen Vytha's request for aid and her proposal for the feast.  
* Locate a brass dragon egg.  
* Potentially acquire fire snake eggs for Shazum.  
* Investigate King Jankor, his fortress, his alliance with Sydon, and the Staff of Thunder and Lightning.  
* Learn more about the "sleeping god" (Chalcia) beneath the volcano.  
* Gather information regarding Sidon and Lutheria.
