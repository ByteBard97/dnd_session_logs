Log

**Unexpected Arrival:**

* As the heroes navigated the rekindled Mithral Forge, they sensed an impending threat. King Driptongue and his ruthless minions began descending the dwarven elevator, determined to seize control of the forge.  
  **Defensive Preparations:**  
* Pyra, the fiery Forgekeeper, teamed up with the party to set up intricate traps throughout the forge, preparing for the inevitable assault by the troglodyte horde.  
  **Hordes Descend:**  
* A relentless wave of troglodytes launched their attack on the forge's defenses, overwhelming the party with sheer numbers and vicious ferocity.  
  **Clash with the Troglodytes:**  
* In a fierce and harrowing battle, the heroes fought valiantly alongside Pyra. Amidst the chaos, Pyra ensnared King Driptongue with her mighty tail, forcing him to surrender.  
  **Aella's Ruthless Justice:**  
* Despite King Driptongue's pleas for mercy, the unyielding Amazon Warrior, Aella, delivered a brutal end to the tyrant, ensuring he would never threaten Estoria again.  
* Pyra cautioned Aella about the repercussions of such brutality, warning that the party's reputation could suffer, but Aella remained steadfast in her actions.  
  **Pyra's Offer:**  
* With King Driptongue defeated, Pyra revealed her ability to craft powerful items for the heroes, offering them legendary gear in exchange for their continued assistance.  
  **Night of Terror:**  
* Exhausted after the day's battles, the party spent the night within the Mithral Forge. They were plagued by a terrifying dream vision from the Titan Lutheria, waking up in cold sweats and experiencing short-term madness.  
  **Centaur Gratitude:**  
* Following the harrowing night, the heroes returned to the banks of the Arkelon River to receive their reward from the centaurs: three potions of heroism, tokens of gratitude for rescuing their missing kin.  
  **Meeting with Volkan:**  
* Back in Estoria, the party consulted with Volkan, the grumpy dwarven blacksmith and true God of the Forge. He explained that he needed King Pythor's hammer to repair the party's broken weapons and armor.  
* The heroes hired Volkan to craft a special suit of plate armor for Rhaena, costing 1500 gp and taking four days to complete.   
  **Hunting the Basilisks:**  
* Determined to eliminate the threat to Princess Anora, the party ventured to the Rock of Estor in search of the petrifying basilisks.  
* Delphi, utilizing his mystic abilities, summoned an octopus familiar to scout the river upstream. The octopus successfully located the basilisks' lair within a hidden cave.
