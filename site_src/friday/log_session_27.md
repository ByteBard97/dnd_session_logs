# Session 27

* We scout the island and run into a troup of amazonian scouts. Aella is unable to convince them of her noble intentions and they fight to the death  
* We find very little evidence of organized civilization on the island except for one Island in the north east. There are many marble statues of various men and marble steps leading down into the earth.
