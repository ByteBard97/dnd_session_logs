Log

* **The Battle of Graxis**: Our heroes faced the bloodthirsty minotaur Graxis in the chilling depths of the Necropolis. Raina bravely leapt onto Xander's sarcophagus, desperately trying to keep it closed as Delphi held the front line, casting spells to protect the party. However, Graxis struck back fiercely, nearly taking Delphi's life with his savage blows.  
* **The Awakening of Xander**: Mid-battle, Xander's sarcophagus opened, revealing the undead form of the first Dragonlord. With an air of silent authority, Xander recognized the heroes as the Chosen of the prophecy. Raina negotiated with the undead lord, who acknowledged the party's bravery and offered his aid.  
* **Victory and Gifts**: A well-placed arrow from Astraeus' bow struck Graxis, bringing the monstrous minotaur to his knees. Xander then rewarded the party with his legendary breastplate and the magical shield and axe once held by the minotaur. He also recognized Delphi as the **Vanished One** of legend, presenting him with the **Crown of the Dragonlords** and revealing a vital clue: Delphi's ancient armor had been stolen by the ruthless Gaius, commander of the Order of Sydon. It now lies hidden on the Island of Yonder.  
* **Consecrated Tombs and Treasures**: After leaving Xander to his eternal rest, the party continued their exploration. Raina used her Divine Sense to identify which tombs were consecrated. They soon entered the tomb of Telamok, awakening the vengeful wight within. After a fierce battle, they laid Telamok low and recovered treasures hidden among his bones.  
* **The Attack of the Black Puddings**: In the tomb of Cosmo Phobas, the walls were coated in black slime that morphed into deadly black puddings when disturbed. The fight was grueling as the oozes split with each slashing blow, forcing the party to retreat and regroup repeatedly. Astraeus' Bow of Cupidity managed to charm some of the slimes, helping them survive this relentless onslaught.  
* **A Close Call with the Golems**: In the tomb of Myrto, Delphi's curiosity led him to attempt to open the sarcophagus. This action animated a clay golem statue, which the party struggled to harm. Realizing the challenge was too great, they retreated as a second golem prepared to attack.  
* **Meeting the Centaurs and Reaching the Great Falls**: After resting in an empty tomb, the heroes left the Necropolis and descended into the mountainous paths around the Arkelon River. They encountered a troop of centaurs, who warned of troglodytes infesting the caves by the Great Falls and requested the party's help in finding two missing centaur warriors.  
* **Exploring the Falls**: Following the centaurs' warnings, the heroes reached the Great Falls of Arkelon. Amid the roar of the cascading water, they discovered the collapsed entrance of an ancient dwarven mine. With Aella's skillful tracking, they found a secret pathway leading behind the waterfall into the heart of the mountain.
