### **The Plan to Unmask the Queen** {#the-plan-to-unmask-the-queen}

* The party decided to descend back to the temple level where they had previously killed the medusa, Leia.  
* With the help of their companion Voratia, they identified the correct door leading to the Temple of Lutheria, where Queen Thessalia was performing a religious ceremony.  
* The group devised a plan to reveal Thessalia's medusa nature to her Amazon followers. Astraeus would cast *Mage Hand*, then turn invisible, sneak in, and remove the queen's helmet to expose her snake hair.  
* To aid in the infiltration, Aella cast *Pass Without Trace*.

### **Confrontation and Battle** {#confrontation-and-battle}

* Astraeus successfully snuck into the chamber while invisible and used the Mage Hand to remove the queen's platinum helmet, revealing her true form.  
* Thessalia accused Aella of bewitching her, while Aella denounced her as an evil usurper, initiating combat by throwing her chakram.  
* Initially, the five Amazon warriors in the room were confused about who to believe. After an impassioned plea from Darian, boosted by Astraeus's Bardic Inspiration, they became bewildered and chose not to fight for either side.  
* Thessalia began the fight by casting *Mirror Image* on herself. The party, including Delphi and Rhaena, focused their attacks on her, eventually destroying the illusory duplicates.  
* The queen's male tiefling attendant, Kazim, remained loyal and unsuccessfully attempted to cast *Hold Person* on Delphi.  
* Unlike her sister Leia, Thessalia's petrifying *Stone Gaze* was a three-stage effect, not an instant petrification. Delphi was briefly affected but managed to save himself from the effect later in the battle.  
* After being severely wounded by the party and seeing her attempt to be healed get thwarted by Delphi's *Counterspell*, Queen Thessalia offered to surrender.  
* Aella refused to show mercy, recounting the murder of her family. Hearing this, Thessalia took her own life.

### **The Aftermath and New Quests** {#the-aftermath-and-new-quests}

* With the usurper dead, the remaining Amazon warriors were left speechless and shattered.  
* Their leader, Colonel Ilia, declared that for Aella to be recognized as the true queen, she must complete a trial of strength: slay the Roc in the Forgotten Sea and bring back its head.  
* The party looted the treasure offerings in the temple. Rhaena discovered her greater family heirloom, a magical hovering chariot, and Aella found a powerful chakram that functions like a "Vorpal Lightning Bolt".  
* The party learned from the goatlings that there was a secret compartment in the statue of Lutheria. Inside, they found a valuable and magical black diamond.  
* They freed a group of brainwashed men who were being kept as "breeding stock". Astraeus used *Dispel Magic* to break their enchantment, and several agreed to join the ship's crew.  
* Finally, they explored the lowest level of the complex and freed the giant Jancan blacksmith, Bront, who is the father of their crewmate, Steros.  
* The goatlings also revealed that the former queen fed a powerful sword to the Hydra, creating an incentive for the party to hunt it down.

### **Wrapping Up and Future Plans** {#wrapping-up-and-future-plans}

* The party has gathered a significant amount of loot, including weapons, armor, and magical items from the armory. They plan to use the newly freed men to help carry it all back to the *Ultros*.  
* Everyone in the party will level up before the next session.  
* The party has decided on their next destination by choosing the Constellation of the Centaur. Their plan is to first visit Turtle Island and then proceed to the island indicated by the constellation.
