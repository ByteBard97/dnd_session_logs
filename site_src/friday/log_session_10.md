**Session 10 Recap: The Fires of the Mithral Forge**

* **Battle in the Dwarven Hall**  
  * After your stealthy approach faltered, you faced off against vicious death dogs feasting on the colossal corpse of a three-headed cerberus.  
  * The death dogs lunged, their diseased bites infecting Delphi.  
  * Together, you vanquished the beasts, cutting down the last one as it tried to flee.  
  * The air hung heavy with the scent of decay and ancient dust.  
* **Exploring the Dwarven Quarters**  
  * Venturing into the abandoned living quarters, you sifted through rubble and relics of a bygone era.  
  * Amidst the debris, you uncovered hidden treasures—glimmers of mithral and ancient dwarven craftsmanship overlooked by the troglodytes.  
  * The silent halls whispered tales of the dwarves who once toiled here, their presence felt in every stone.  
* **The Menace of the Cockatrices**  
  * Proceeding cautiously, you heard unsettling, chicken-like squawks echoing through the corridors.  
  * Aella scouted ahead, discovering an old storage room filled with rotten sacks and broken crates—a remnant of the mine's operational days.  
  * Further down, she spotted the Bird Pens: a chilling scene with a petrified troglodyte and a cockatrice lurking nearby.  
  * Formulating a plan, you barricaded the doorway with Rheana's help, using old crates to trap the creature inside.  
* **Confrontation in the Barracks**  
  * Across the hall, you encountered three more death dogs turned to stone, guarded by two vigilant cockatrices.  
  * The cockatrices screeched and attacked, their beady eyes glowing with arcane menace.  
  * Aella narrowly avoided their petrifying gaze before you swiftly dispatched them, ensuring the safety of the passage.  
* **The Deceptive Elevator Trap**  
  * Returning to the dwarven elevator, you noticed a hastily scribbled note in Dwarvish near the door—a cryptic reminder about a password.  
  * Trusting the troglodyte king's word, you recited "Barazgul" (meaning "mithral") as you descended.  
  * Alarms blared as oil began seeping from dragon-shaped spouts—realizing too late that the king had deceived you.  
  * Thinking quickly, Delphi reversed the elevator's direction, ascending as the flow of oil subsided.  
  * Determined to outsmart the trap, you clogged the dragon mouths with debris, reducing the impending flames' impact.  
  * The elevator descended once more; flames erupted but were dampened by your quick thinking, allowing you to reach the lower levels singed but alive.  
* **The Silent Armory**  
  * Stepping into a vast armory once brimming with legendary weapons, you found only echoes of the past.  
  * Empty racks and shattered armaments told stories of looting and time's relentless decay.  
  * Despite thorough searching, valuable relics eluded you, perhaps hidden or long removed.  
* **Encounter with the Forgekeeper**  
  * Moving south, you discovered a grand chamber dominated by a bubbling pool of lava—a creature swam beneath its molten surface.  
  * Two death dogs guarded an enigmatic bronze sphere with a protruding spout.  
  * Without hesitation, Aella led the charge against the guardians.  
  * Rheana invoked the **Fear of the Dragonlords**, her presence unsettling the death dogs and giving you the upper hand.  
  * Upon their defeat, a serpentine figure emerged from the lava—the salamander known as Pyra, the Forgekeeper.  
  * She warned of the enchanted sphere, a deadly trap designed by the dwarves to keep her bound.  
* **Disarming the Frozen Trap**  
  * Investigating the sphere, you attempted to disable it but only delayed its activation.  
  * As ominous clicks sounded, Pyra urged you to flee before a blast of freezing magic engulfed the room.  
  * Refusing to be thwarted, you heaved the sphere onto Rheana's sturdy back.  
  * With a combined effort, you hurled it over the edge, watching as it plummeted into the waterfall below—its icy explosion freezing the cascading waters momentarily.  
* **Alliance with Pyra**  
  * Grateful for your intervention, Pyra introduced herself and revealed her plight.  
  * Tricked by the dwarves, she had been bound to power the forge for centuries.  
  * She offered to reignite the legendary Mithral Forge if you agreed to destroy the rune tablet anchoring her to this place.  
  * Pyra cautioned you about the young cerberus ahead, a fearsome guardian sent by Lutheria herself.  
  * She suggested diplomacy but remained ready to assist in battle if needed.  
* **The Fierce Battle with the Cerberus**  
  * Undeterred, Delphi approached the cerberus, attempting to negotiate.  
  * The beast snarled, its three heads echoing with malice, and vowed to devour you all.  
  * The fight was brutal—the cerberus's powerful jaws and venomous bites pushed you to your limits.  
  * Pyra joined the fray, ensnaring the creature with her fiery tail and encasing one of its heads in hardened magma.  
  * Amidst the chaos, several of you suffered grievous wounds and the sting of poison.  
  * In a final, decisive move, Delphi unleashed a scorching firebolt, striking down the monstrous hound.  
* **Liberation and Rekindling the Forge**  
  * Among the cerberus's hoard, you found treasures and the rune tablet binding Pyra.  
  * Honoring your promise, Delphi shattered the tablet; Pyra sighed with relief as the ancient bonds dissolved.  
  * In gratitude, she descended into the depths, her fiery essence merging with the forge's heart.  
  * The Mithral Forge roared back to life—the chambers illuminated by the glow of molten metal and the rhythmic pulse of ancient machinery.  
  * As you caught your breath, the distant sound of gears turning signaled the elevator's activation.  
  * **Something—or someone—was descending from above, drawn by the forge's awakening...**
