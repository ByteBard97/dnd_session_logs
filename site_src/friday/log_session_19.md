# Session 19

Log

## **The Temple's Hidden Depths**

* Your invisibility held as you descended below the Temple of Lutheria, where rows of wine casks concealed a more sinister trade  
* In these depths, you met Lyra the Vigilant, one of the temple's trusted guardians  
* The silence spell that perpetually shrouded these chambers muffled your fight  
* When Lyra fell, her black sword \- a badge of her authority \- became yours

## **The Prison Below**

* Behind the reinforced door lay the truth of the temple's wine merchant facade  
* Children from Stygian Row filled iron cages \- chosen because their families lacked the influence to seek justice  
* These were meant to be the cult's newest initiates, destined for dark ceremonies under the full moon  
* Lyra's desk held letters revealing the temple's true purpose \- human sacrifice masked by wine festivals

## **The Serpent's Power**

* From the opened sewer grate emerged an ancient horror \- a serpentine creature of bone and malevolent magic  
* Its power turned Astreus against the party, proving why the temple chose these tunnels for their dark work  
* The creature's influence spread through your group like poison before retreating into the vast sewer network beneath Mytros  
* Even after breaking free, you felt the lingering touch of its evil

## **The Dark Ceremony**

* Beyond the prison, you witnessed High Priestess Septia herself leading a ritual  
* A victim lay bound upon the stone bier while cultists chanted in eerie silence  
* This was one of the monthly ceremonies that kept the temple's true masters in power  
* The chamber held dark treasures, including a mysterious floating tome that caught Delphi's eye

## **Queen Vallus's Justice**

* The Queen of Mytros, herself a goddess of wisdom, recognized the evidence of corruption you brought before her  
* Each rescued child's story confirmed what she had long suspected about the wine merchant family  
* She mobilized her forces against the temple, specifically the amazon warrior Makhaira and her squad  
* Your reward was an elegant Handbag of Holding \- later traded to secure the dark tome from the raid

## **Flight to the Forge**

* Captain Sammy, a dwarf whose reputation on the river is unmatched, agreed to brave the dangerous rapids  
* Through the night, your magic aided her navigation of the treacherous waters of the Arkelon  
* Her ship, "The Mariner," proved worthy of its captain's confidence  
* By dawn, you'd reached the hidden entrance to the Mithral Forge

## **At the Forge**

* Nyssi triggered the mechanism that parts the great falls, revealing the secret dock  
* Volkan and Pyrah had completed your commissions:  
  * Plate armor worthy of a hero  
  * Chakrams forged from pure mithral  
* Then Volkan revealed his discovery \- an ancient Keledone, one of the legendary mechanical servants  
* To restore this marvel would require both mithral and gold in significant quantities
