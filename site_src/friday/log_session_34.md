# Session 34 [Session 34](#session-34)

*   **Scorpion Battle Commencement:**
    *   The session began with the party facing three normal giant scorpions and the massive Scorpion Matriarch, alongside the Aresian warrior monks.
    *   Aella took flight, engaging the Matriarch and successfully landing two powerful chakram strikes, dealing significant damage.
    *   The remaining Aresian monks attacked another large scorpion, managing to knock it prone before being wiped out by a poison spray attack from a different scorpion, which killed all five.

*   **Astraeus's gambit:**
    *   Astraeus cast *Hypnotic Pattern*, successfully incapacitating one of the large scorpions.

*   **Centaurs' Arrival:**
    *   Just as the battle turned grim, Nessa and her band of twelve centaurs charged over the dunes to join the fight against the scorpions.
    *   The centaurs effectively turned the tide, working with the party to defeat the remaining scorpions and the Matriarch.

*   **Post-Battle Introductions & Lore:**
    *   Nessa introduced herself and her tribe, explaining they were cursed by the Lotus Witch.
    *   She revealed that all centaurs on the island transform into scorpions upon reaching adulthood. The only escape is to form a sacred bond with a mortal partner and leave the island.
    *   The party learned that the Lotus Witch, a powerful gynosphinx, resides in the central tower.

*   **The Flower Field and the Tower:**
    *   The centaurs led the party to the edge of a field of beautiful yellow wildflowers surrounding the tower.
    *   They warned that the field is enchanted and distorts time, making it impossible to cross safely. Flying over it is also deadly, as it triggers lightning storms.

*   **Testing the Field:**
    *   The party conducted several experiments to understand the field's properties:
        *   **Firebolt:** A *Firebolt* fizzled out, aging rapidly and disappearing before hitting anything.
        *   **Thrown Rock:** A thrown rock aged, weathered, and turned to dust mid-air.
        *   **Scorpion Carcass:** A dead scorpion's carcass was thrown in and rapidly decayed to bone before vanishing.
        *   **Live Scorpion:** A captured live scorpion was thrown in and experienced horrifying, rapid cycles of aging, transformation, and death before disintegrating.
        *   **Familiar:** A familiar sent through the field was destroyed, its spiritual connection violently severed.

*   **Conclusion of the Session:**
    *   The party, having exhausted their immediate ideas for bypassing the field, took a long rest with the centaurs to prepare for their next attempt to reach the tower.
