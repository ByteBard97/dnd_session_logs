# Session 29 {#session-29}

**Objective:** Infiltrate the Sacred Temple on Themis to find allies and confront the usurper queen.

**Status:** In Progress

* **Entry to the Sacred Temple**

  * The party descended the marble staircase into the underground temple complex.  
  * Aella discovered the entrance mechanism: a rotating section of the bronze door with a hand-shaped imprint that granted entry.  
* **Basilisk Pens & Guard Post**

  * After a short rest, the party surprised and attacked the guards in the first chamber.  
  * Astraeus used his enchanted bow to charm an Amazon warrior named Talia.  
  * Aella killed the dwarven basilisk-keeper Nura and another Amazon warrior.  
  * The caged basilisks were neutralized by covering their pens with sailcloth.  
  * The bodies of the slain Amazons were thrown from the cliff.  
* **Intelligence from Talia**

  * The party interrogated the charmed Amazon, Talia, and learned key information:  
    * **Leadership:** The complex is ruled by the "false Queen" Thesilea VI and her sister, Leia. A third sister, Moxena, left Themis years ago.  
    * **Prisoners:** Captives include lizardfolk loyal to Queen Vytha, a giant Jancan blacksmith named Bront, and Darien, a high-ranking loyalist to the true queen imprisoned for 13 years.  
    * **The Statues:** The marble statues outside are the petrified "favored sons of Lutheria," who are sometimes fed to the basilisks.  
    * **Secret Entrance:** There is an underwater entrance to the temple, but Talia does not know its exact location.  
  * Talia was gagged and left tied up in the entry corridor.  
* **The Hydra Tunnels**

  * The party discovered the key to the next door was on Nura's necklace, which was on the body they had thrown off the cliff. Stimfay's search for the body was futile.  
  * After Aella picked the difficult lock, the party entered a corridor with honeycomb-like holes in the walls.  
  * Aella spotted a pressure plate trap on the floor. As she investigated, serpentine hydra heads lunged from the holes and attacked.  
  * Astraeus returned to Talia, who revealed the password to pacify the creature: "By the Grace of Lutheria."  
  * Whispering the password allowed safe passage but brought back unsettling memories of the party's nightmares from Lutheria.  
* **Amazon Barracks & The Prison Key**

  * The party found a side door leading to the Amazon Barracks.  
  * Astraeus peeked inside, spotting two warriors playing cards.  
  * The party stormed the room, with Rhaena and Aella quickly dispatching the two Amazons.  
  * A search of the bodies revealed a necklace heavy with keys.  
* **The Prisons & Darien**

  * The keys opened a heavy door in the barracks, revealing a hallway lined with prison cells.  
  * The party found two lizardfolk prisoners and a scarred, silent young woman.  
  * "The last cell housed a scarred, silent young woman.  
  * Recalling Talia's mention of an important prisoner named "Darien" loyal to the old ways, Aella attempted to speak to the woman, revealing her own identity and denouncing the usurpers. The woman remained unresponsive.  
  * Delphi detected a magical acoustic anomaly in the cell, suggesting a *silence* spell.  
  * Aella used the keys to open the cell door.
