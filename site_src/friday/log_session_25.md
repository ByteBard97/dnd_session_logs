**Quest Log Update: Fire Island Fortress**

* **Exploration Continued:** Advanced deeper into the Firewalker volcano fortress after clearing the first egg nursery.  
* **Walkway Navigation:** Identified and safely bypassed a collapsible bridge trap on the walkways.  
* **Throne Room Checked:** Confirmed the previously conquered Throne Room was empty.  
* **Sleeping Quarters Cleared:** Defeated a guard and searched the sleeping quarters. Recovered volcanic gemstones, a tooth necklace, and a **curious metal cogwheel** of unknown purpose.  
* **Stables Secured:** Neutralized the handler in the stables. Calmed the agitated Giant Lizard mounts.  
* **Met Steros the Smith:** Discovered a forge room occupied by **Steros**, a ten-fingered Cyclops smith (a Jancan).  
  * Learned Steros wishes to find his father, **Bront**, who was captured by Amazons and taken to **Themis**.  
  * **Made an Agreement:** Promised Steros passage off Fire Island and help finding his father.  
  * **Crucial Intel:** In return, Steros revealed the location of the last **Brass Dragon Egg**: it's in the cave used by the **Salamanders** as their nest.  
  * Steros is preparing to leave and will await the party's return.  
*   
* **Prisoners Rescued:** Found captured **Bloodscale Tribe** warriors (allies of Queen Vytha) held in cages.  
  * Intimidated the guards (using Jankor's captured staff) into fleeing.  
  * Freed the Bloodscale prisoners; they await escort.  
*   
* **Worship Chamber Cleared:** Entered the Chamber of Worship. The remaining occupants (Jankor's former Queen Consort and her Shaman) fled upon seeing the party and Jankor's staff.  
  * Noted the statue of Sydon had valuable **emerald eyes**. An attempt to remove one triggered an ominous thunderclap; the gems were left undisturbed.  
*   
* **Current Situation:**  
  * King Jankor is defeated, his Staff of Thunder and Lightning secured.  
  * The young Brass Dragon, Pyraxis, is captive and subdued but hostile.  
  * Key areas of the fortress explored and secured.  
  * Gained Steros as an ally with knowledge of the final egg's location.  
  * Freed allied Bloodscale prisoners.  
*   
* **Next Steps:**  
  * Retrieve the **Brass Dragon Egg** from the **Salamander cave**.  
  * Decide whether to retrieve the **Fire Snake Eggs**.  
  * Escort Steros and the rescued Bloodscale prisoners out of the fortress.  
  * Return to Queen Vytha.
