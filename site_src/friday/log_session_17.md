# Session 17 {#session-17}

Agenda

* **Aella:** Gather allies and return to the Isle of Themis and overthrow the usurpers who murdered your mother and stole her throne  
* **Astreus:** Queen Vallus has guided you to seek out the Lotus Witch, who may possess the fabled grimoire you need for your chronicles. She also suggested consulting the Fates, who could craft an artifact to help ensure you live to tell your tale.  
* **Delphi:** Xander gave you your crown and his mystic armaments. Your fabled armor has been stolen by Gaius, the commander of the Order of Sydon. He keeps your armor in his fortress on the Island of Yonder, which is heavily fortified.  
* **Rhaena:** You have recovered your family ring, a lost artifact tied to your erased past. The whispers of your Mother urge you onwardâ€”to seek the greater family artifact held by the Amazon Queen, somewhere in the Cerulean sea.  
* **Party:**   
  * We will investigate the cult of Lutheria  
  * We will Investigate the Cult of the Snake

Log

* We started at the Satyr's Tail, a crusty tavern in the slum. We finish talking with the bar tender and decide to shadow the two brothers, Neco and Grecos to figure out where their hideout is.  
* Delphi's owl familiar soared above Mytros' lamp-lit streets, its silent wings cutting through the gathering dusk as it tracked the brothers Nero and Grecos. Meanwhile, as your party waited in the shadows below, fate delivered an unexpected messenger: an envoy from Lord Taran Neurdagon himself, one of the city's most powerful merchants, bearing an offer of 5,000 gold pieces for the head of the mysterious Lady of Coins.  
* The owl's pursuit led to an abandoned tenement near the edges of Stygian Row, where you discovered a hidden entrance to the city's labyrinthine sewers. Though Aella's tracking skills served well in those fetid tunnels for a time, the maze-like passages eventually forced you to emerge near the harbor, your quarry lost in the darkness below.  
* After cleansing yourselves at the Bathhouse of Vallus, fortune smiled upon you through the whispers of street children, who spoke of strange comings and goings around the mighty Colossus of Pythor. This bronze guardian, one of the twin colossi that have watched over Mytros' harbor since before the First War, held secrets of its own. With Queen Vallus' aid securing the password, you ascended through the mechanical marvel, your excuses failing to convince the minotaur guards who recognized you instead as the heroes who had stopped Sydon's storm.  
* In the Colossus' head, overlooking the glittering harbor where ships swayed gently at anchor, came a revelation that struck to the heart of Aella's quest: The Lady of Coins unveiled herself as Moxena, sister to one of the very usurpers who had murdered Aella's mother on the Isle of Themis. Yet the truth proved more complex \- it was Moxena who had discovered young Aella that bloody night, and rather than following orders to kill the child, had secretly arranged her escape.  
* Having failed in her own later attempt to overthrow her sisters, Moxena now offers an alliance from her bronze sanctuary: aid in Aella's quest to reclaim her rightful throne, but first demands proof of loyalty \- Lord Neurdagon's head. Three petrified victims stand as silent witnesses to your oath, sworn not to reveal her hidden stronghold within the ancient Colossus.  
* The pieces of prophecy begin to align \- the Oracle's words about finding an ally "in the head of god" now ring with new meaning, though whether Moxena's offer represents salvation or a deeper betrayal remains to be seen. The path to Themis grows clearer, but as with all things in Mytros, the price of vengeance may prove steep indeed.
