Notes

* **Rumor from the Innkeeper:** Thericles who works in the vineyard, has a missing daughter.  
* **Volkan's Forge:** In the heart of the city, you visited Volkan's Hall. There, you encountered Volkan, a gruff dwarf blacksmith who revealed himself as the God of the Forge. He spoke of the ancient Mithral Mines, cursed by the Titan Lutheria, and asked you to cleanse them and rekindle the legendary Mithral Forge.  
* **The Mysterious Necklace:** While exploring the bustling agora, Delphi was approached by a ragged beggar offering a gleaming emerald necklace. Ignoring the wary glances of nearby merchants, Delphi purchased it. Upon placing it in his pack, he felt an overwhelming sensation of fullness, as if he'd feasted for days.  
* **Audience with King Pythor:** Summoned to the palace, you met King Pythor, the God of Battle. With heavy heart, he revealed that the Titan Sydon demanded the sacrifice of his daughter, Princess Anora, to prevent a catastrophic assault on Estoria by centaur and cyclops forces. Bound by the Oath of Peace, Pythor could not intervene and pleaded for your aid.  
* **Parley with Gaius:** Pythor introduced you to Gaius, the stern commander of the Order of Sydon. You engaged in tense negotiations, seeking a way to save Anora and avert the impending doom. Gaius remained unyielding, emphasizing the severity of defying a Titan's will.  
* **The Rock of Estor:** Determined to understand the gravity of the sacrifice, you visited the Rock of Estor on the Arkelon River. There, you witnessed a chilling ritual: a cow bound to the rock, petrified by basilisks emerging from the depths, then shattered and consumed. The ominous sight underscored the peril Anora faced.  
* **The Dragon Shrine's Plight:** Seeking to fulfill one of your Great Labors, you headed to the Dragon Shrine. Aesop, the shrine's keeper, delivered dire newsâ€”the sacred Horn of Balmytria had been stolen by mischievous goatlings. Without it, your quest to drink from the horn was in jeopardy.  
* **Trail into the Oldwoods:** Following a haphazard trail of spilled wine and tiny hoofprints, you ventured into the dense and shadowy Oldwoods south of the city. The forest grew darker and more foreboding as you pressed on.  
* **Rescuing Corinna:** Deep within the woods, a terrified Corinna burst into a clearing, pursued by a band of mocking goatlings. She begged for your help to save her and her friends from a grim fate at the hands of a mysterious woman named Demetria. You confronted the goatlings, who taunted you with vicious insults, but you stood your ground and defeated them.  
* **A New Ally and a Dire Mission:** With Corinna safe for the moment, she revealed that Demetria holds the Horn of Balmytria within the depths of the Oldwoods. Determined to save her friends and reclaim the horn, she urged you to continue deeper into the forest.
