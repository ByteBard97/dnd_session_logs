# Session 3 {#session-3}

* **After defeating Braeca and his soldiers in the upper chamber of the temple, the heroes secured the area and ensured no immediate threats remained.**  
* **They spoke with Proteus, the elder temple attendant, who informed them about the sea hag Heleka and her capture of the Oracle, Versi.**  
* **The heroes decided to explore the temple further to find a way to rescue Versi from the basement levels.**  
* **They discovered a locked stairway door leading to the temple basement and searched for the key to proceed.**  
* **In the Attendants' Chambers, they encountered four enchanted flying swords set as a trap by Heleka.**  
* **Instead of destroying the flying swords, the heroes cleverly locked them away, neutralizing the threat without further combat.**  
* **With the key obtained from the chambers, they unlocked the stairway door and descended into the basement.**  
* **At the bottom of the stairs, they were ambushed by a mimic disguised as a door, which they defeated after a brief skirmish.**  
* **Entering the Oracle's grotto, they navigated through the mist-filled cave, remaining cautious of potential dangers.**  
* **They identified and avoided a rug of smothering that was placed as another trap by Heleka.**  
* **Proceeding deeper, they encountered a water weird guarding the entrance to the Oracle's chamber.**  
* **Engaging in battle, the heroes defeated the water weird, clearing the path to Versi.**  
* **In the Oracle's chamber, they found Heleka tormenting Versi and witnessed the slain temple attendant who could not be saved.**  
* **A fierce battle ensued between the heroes and Heleka, culminating in the defeat of the sea hag.**  
* **With Heleka vanquished, the heroes freed Versi from her watery bonds and offered her comfort.**  
* **Versi thanked the heroes for their bravery and introduced herself, expressing sorrow over the loss of her attendant.**  
* **The Oracle delivered her prophecy, outlining the three Great Labors the heroes must undertake:**  
  * **Claim the weapons of the first Dragonlords.**  
  * **Light the fires of the Mithral Forge.**  
  * **Drink from the Horn of Balmytria.**  
* **Versi spoke privately with each hero, providing personal insights related to their individual epic paths.**  
* **The heroes discussed the prophecy and, with guidance from Kyrah, decided their next course of action.**  
* **Kyrah challenged Astreus to an epic poetry competition to see who could write the best poem about the heroes' journey**  
* **Before departing, they swore an Oath of Fellowship, uniting them in their quest to fulfill the prophecy and save Thylea.**  
* **They then made their way to the city of Estoria and observed an encampment of fierce looking centaurs outside the north gate who looked ready to make war on the city**  
* **We stayed at the Dragon's tooth inn and had good food and drink**  
* **Astreaus played music for the crowd and made some gold for the party**  
* **We spoke with the innkeeper, Delphion and he gave us some clues about what to do next**  
* **We heard that the cult of Sydon wants Pythor to sacrifice his daughter on the rock of Estor where should would be devoured by monsters**  
* **We know there is something going on with the Mithril Mines and God of the Forge, Volkan who has a forge in the city**  
* **We know that there is something to do in the Necropolis at Telemok**  
* **Delphi's prophecy: "**You must retake your famed armor and crown. Seek them out in the Necropolis at Telamok. Old friends wait for you there.
