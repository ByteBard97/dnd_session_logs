# Session 37: The Waking Dream

*   **The Ritual of Waking Dreams:**
    *   The party returned to the Lotus Witch's tower with their three dragon eggs (two silver, one brass).
    *   The Gynosphinx greeted them, explaining the process would be a "waking dream" where their souls would forge the destinies of their new companions. She instructed them to "look through" the eggs to see the potential within.
    *   The ritual involved three choices for each hero, shaping their dragon's foundation, personality, and bond.

*   **Forging the Dragons' Souls:**
    *   **The Cradle of Becoming (Spirit's Foundation):**
        *   **Astraeus (Silver Dragon):** Chose a **Mystical Academy**. The vision showed his dragon exploring a vast library, surrounded by lore and magic, fostering boundless curiosity.
        *   **Delphi (Bronze Dragon):** Chose a **Chaotic Battlefield**. The vision showed his dragon forged in the crucible of conflict, learning resilience and the harsh realities of war.
        *   **Rhaena (Silver Dragon):** Chose a **Dangerous Wilderness**. The vision showed her dragon learning the unforgiving lessons of survival, with senses honed to a razor's edge.
    *   **The Dance of Days (Shared Years):**
        *   **Astraeus:** Chose **Shared Artistic Creation**. The vision was of a collaborative partnership, with the dragon as both muse and masterpiece in poetry, sculpture, and music.
        *   **Delphi:** Chose a **Life of Adventure**. The vision showed them as true survivors, constantly exploring forgotten ruins and navigating treacherous paths together.
        *   **Rhaena:** Chose **Relentless Martial Training**. The vision was of a focused training montage, tempering the dragon's raw power into a deadly weapon reflective of Rhaena's paladin code.
    *   **The Soul's Echo (The Bond):**
        *   **Astraeus:** Chose a **Bond of Equals**. The vision was of a deep, abiding respect, two halves of a single heroic whole.
        *   **Delphi:** Chose a **Sanctuary of Trust**. The vision showed them as secret keepers and comforts to one another, a refuge from a harsh world.
        *   **Rhaena:** Chose a **Guardian and Ward**. The vision depicted a primal, protective bond, with each guarding the other unconditionally.

*   **The Hatching and Naming:**
    *   The ritual concluded, and three young dragons (not wyrmlings, but large enough for a medium creature to ride at half speed) emerged from the eggs.
    *   **Delphi** named his female bronze dragon **Avia**. Her scales have a unique silver lightning bolt pattern on her chest.
    *   **Astraeus** named his goofy, playful female silver dragon **Soraya**.
    *   **Rhaena** named her male silver dragon **Argon**.

*   **A Paradox in Time:**
    *   Upon leaving the tower, the party discovered the *Ultros* was gone.
    *   Their dragons spotted the ship approaching in the distance, revealing a time displacement—they had arrived back on the island *before* their past selves had returned from the Ritual of Remembrance.
    *   To avoid a causality paradox, the party decided to hide and wait.
    *   **Six Days of Downtime:** The party waited for six days on Scorpion Island.
        *   Delphi spent the time crafting scrolls.
        *   Astraeus practiced his music with the Boreal Harp, earning a permanent **+1 bonus to his Performance skill**.

*   **Return to the Seas:**
    *   After their past selves completed their journey—retrieving the eggs and entering the tower for the first time—the party boarded the *Ultros*. Kyra gave a knowing look and quietly informed the crew of the situation to avoid confusion.
    *   Setting sail for the Isle of the Fates, Astraeus played the Boreal Harp for a full day. His successful performance (rolling a 23) created powerful winds that sped the ship, cutting a full day off their travel time.
    *   The dragons spent the journey fishing for themselves in the sea.

*   **Revisiting Turtle Island:**
    *   On Day 39 of their journey, the party arrived at Jazirat Zulhaf (Turtle Island).
    *   They met with the marid trader, **Shazum**, and gave him the giant scorpion tail. In exchange, he gave them the promised **Orb of Star Metal**.
    *   Shazum offered another trade: a story for a treasure. For a tale of their encounter with the Sphinx, he would give them a tarnished bronze coin.
    *   Astraeus recounted their adventure with the Lotus Witch. Impressed, Shazum gave them the coin.
    *   **Tarnished Coin:** A magical item that, when flipped at dawn, provides a limited form of *augury* about the temperament of the sea for that day's voyage.
    *   The session concluded with the party on Turtle Island, preparing to continue their journey to the Isle of the Fates.
