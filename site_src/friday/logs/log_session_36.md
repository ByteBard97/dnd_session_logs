# Session 36: Riddles, Revelations, and Rituals

*   **The Sphinx's Final Riddles:** The session began with the party facing the Lotus Witch's third question.
    *   **Question 3 - The Twin Titans:** After deliberation and consulting Kyra, who confirmed the lore of the "Constellation of the Twins," the party correctly answered that **Sydon and Lutheria** were the two Titans who sprang from a single pit.
    *   **Question 4 (Bonus) - The Myrmekes:** Opting for a bonus question, the party was asked who created the Myrmekes race. A masterful history check from Delphi revealed it was **Talius**, the titan of crafting, and provided deep lore about the conflict their creation caused among the Titans.

*   **A Fount of Knowledge:** Having passed her test, the Sphinx offered the party her counsel:
    *   She informed **Astraeus** that the grimoire he seeks is held by a tiefling priest of Lutheria named **Condorus** on the **Isle of Yonder**. She also suggested the **Three Fates** might possess such an item.
    *   She refused **Delphi's** request to magically age their dragon eggs, calling it a "perversion." However, she offered to use her power over time to help hatch the eggs, ensuring the wyrmlings would emerge as formidable young dragons.
    *   She scornfully rejected a plea to lift the curse on the centaurs, explaining it was a just and eternal punishment for their ancestors' destruction of a living library. She revealed that an escape from the curse has always existed: a centaur can leave the island and live a normal life if they form a sacred bond with a mortal partner.
    *   Regarding the spirit-filled box, she advised that the "hero's path" was not to fight the spirits but to release them through a ritual that honored their stories and brought them peace.
    *   She provided crucial intelligence for dealing with the **Three Fates**, describing them as a coven of ancient hags and giving advice on how to appeal to each of their unique personalities (Morta, Nona, and Decima).
    *   She confirmed that the **Constellation of the Gigan** leads to the Isle of Yonder, and the **Constellation of the Bard** leads to the Isle of the Fates.

*   **A Jump Through Time:** Upon leaving the tower's temporal field, the party discovered that **six days** had passed.

*   **The Ritual of Release:** Back aboard the *Ultros*, the party performed a ritual to release the spirits from the lockbox.
    *   Under the moonlight, Kyra began with a mournful song that turned the spirits' rage into sorrow.
    *   **Astraeus** wove their stories into a beautiful lament, promising their sacrifices would be remembered (Performance: 23).
    *   **Delphi** offered a cleric's prayer to Zeus to guide their souls to a peaceful afterlife (Wisdom: 16).
    *   **Rhaena**, as a paladin, condemned their murderer, Estor Arkelander, and offered the spirits justice through a powerful speech (Persuasion with Advantage).
    *   **Aella** honored the fallen warriors with a formal Amazonian battle cry and salute (Survival: 17).

*   **A Third Dragon Egg:** The ritual was a success. The spirits of the Gygans, Amazons, and Centaurs found peace and faded into the moonlight. Inside the box, the party found their prize: a large, opalescent **silver dragon egg**, which began to pulse with a warm, golden light.

*   **Next Steps:** The session concluded with the party in possession of three dragon eggs (one brass, two silver) and preparing to return to the Lotus Witch's tower to have them hatched.
