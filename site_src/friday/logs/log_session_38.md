# **Session 38: The Swamp of Dreadful Fates**
Session 38 Recap - August 1, 2025

* Returned to Jazirat Zulhaf (Turtle Island) and met again with the marid, Shazum.
* Accepted a new quest from Shazum to travel to the Isle of the Fates.
    * The task is to retrieve a sample of the bubbling yellow ichor, which contains larvae with mortal faces, from a pit in the Fates' lair.
    * The reward is a choice between three items: the Hordemall warhammer, a sea chart to two unknown islands, or two vials of Gorgon's blood.
* Purchased an Erosion Potion from Shazum's available wares.
* Aella received her custom-forged +1 mithral chain shirt, which does not require attunement.
* Set sail from Turtle Island, beginning a two-day voyage to the Isle of the Fates.
* Initiated downtime activities during the sea journey: Delphi began training to improve his Constitution, while Astraeus continued practicing the Boreal Harp.
* Arrived at the Isle of the Fates, finding it a dark, foreboding island wracked by a violent storm.
* Navigated a treacherous inlet and began exploring a dangerous mangrove swamp.
* Traversed rickety, unstable wooden walkways suspended over murky water.
* Encountered hostile creatures within the swamp:
    * Delphi's dragon, Avia, was attacked by a swarm of vicious quippers while in the water.
    * Aella fell from a walkway and was briefly grabbed and pulled under by an amorphous swamp creature before she managed to escape.
    * While crossing a gap, Astraeus was grabbed by a tendril from the same creature and grappled.
    * Rhaena's dragon, Argon, successfully attacked the tendril, freeing Astraeus from its grasp. The session ended as the party prepared to deal with the monster lurking below.
