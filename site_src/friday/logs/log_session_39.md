# **Quest Log: The Isle of the Fates**

* **Navigated the Cursed Bog:** After a terrifying encounter with the Bog Terror, we chose to press forward rather than engage the monstrosity in its swampy domain. We successfully navigated the treacherous maze of collapsing walkways, finally emerging from the oppressive mangrove swamp into a sunken hollow at the island's center.  
* **Met the Fates' Sentinel:** At the edge of a fetid pond filled with the skeletal remains of past supplicants, we were met by Moira, a stoic and cursed lamia. After we stated our purpose to seek the wisdom of the Eternal Three, she agreed to guide us into their lair, but warned that our dragon companions were not welcome and must remain outside.  
* **Bargained with the Three Fates:** We entered the hags' sanctumâ€”a horrifying cavern dominated by a bubbling pit of ichor filled with larvae bearing mortal faces, and a massive loom carved from dragon bone. There we met the crones: the cruel matriarch Granny Morta, the resentful Nona, and the bashful Decima. We negotiated for knowledge and power, and the price for each bargain was a piece of ourselves.  
  * **Delphi's Past Revealed:** Seeking to reclaim the memories of his five-century-long absence and to understand the nature of his descendant, Gaius, Delphi surrendered his **Body's Resilience**. In exchange for the truth, he accepted a permanent curse, leaving him with disadvantage on all Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws.  
  * **Rhaena's Destiny Unveiled:** To learn the truth of her erased family and her destiny to "break the power of death," Rhaena gave the Fates **Her Breath**. The hags drew out a part of her life force, permanently halving the healing she receives from rest. In return, the Loom of Fates showed her a vision: her family was slaughtered by the goddess Lutheria, and their souls are now trapped within her crystal scythe. To free them, Rhaena must shatter it.  
  * **Astraeus's Survival Secured:** To gain the artifact of survival promised by Queen Vallus, Astraeus traded his **Memory**. Under the Fates' guidance, he wove his own destiny into the **Cloak of Displacement**. As the final thread was placed, the hags plunged their spectral hands into his mind and devoured his knowledge, leaving him with disadvantage on all History, Arcana, Religion, and Nature checks.  
* **Secured the Ichor:** While the hags were theatrically consuming Rhaena's life force, Aella seized the opportunity. She stealthily approached the bubbling pit and successfully scooped a vial of the foul, larva-filled ichor, fulfilling our pact with the marid Shazum.  
* **Leveled Up:** Having survived the physical and spiritual trials of both Scorpion Island and the Isle of the Fates, the party has advanced to **Level 9**.  
* **Completed Pact with Shazum:** Upon returning to the Turtle Island, we presented the ichor to Shazum. Rather than accept one of the offered magical items, Astraeus used his formidable powers of persuasion to negotiate a cash buyout. We successfully traded the ichor for **9,000 gold pieces** and a **Potion of Water Breathing**.  
* **Next Destination:** With new power, new burdens, and a heavier purse, our journey now takes us to the **Isle of Yonder**.
