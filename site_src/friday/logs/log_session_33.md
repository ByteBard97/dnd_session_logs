### **A Troubled Voyage: Lutheria's Nightmare**

As the *Ultros* sailed toward the island marked by the Constellation of the Centaur, the party was assailed by a shared, horrifying dream sent by the Titan, Lutheria. The vision depicted shipwrecked sailors succumbing to cannibalism on a desolate shore. The dream's potent magic overwhelmed both Astraeus and Delphi, who awoke consumed by a violent bloodlust, turning on their companions.

A chaotic struggle ensued below decks.
*   Aella and Rhaena, having resisted the dream's influence, fought to restrain their friends without causing serious harm.
*   Aella managed to grapple the frenzied Astraeus, while Rhaena attempted to subdue him with nets.
*   The conflict was resolved when Rhaena, having attuned to the recently acquired **Titan's Bane** , struck her companions with the flat of the adamantine blade. The sword's inherent *dispel magic* property successfully broke Lutheria's enchantment, first on Astraeus and then on Delphi, returning them to their senses.
*   In the aftermath, Delphi noted that he should consider attuning to the **Codex of Nocturnal Mysteries** before sleeping to gain its advantage on dream-related checks and prevent future mental assaults.

### **Arrival at Scorpion Island**

After three days at sea, the party arrived at a flat, arid island dominated by a single, ominous black tower at its center. An impressive History check from Astraeus confirmed this was **Scorpion Island** , a known proving ground for Aresian warriors due to its dangerous fauna.

The party moored the *Ultros* and took a rowboat to a shore marked by crumbling fortifications and beautiful, flowering trees. There, they encountered the very same Aresian warrior monks they had met on Turtle Island, led by Captain Galenus.

### **Counsel with the Monks of Aresia**

Galenus and his lieutenants confirmed the island's dark history:
*   The island's centaur tribe was cursed long ago by a powerful gynosphinx known as the **Lotus Witch** , who resides in the central tower.
*   The centaurs had destroyed a "living library" of knowledge carved into the island's trees, and as punishment, the witch cursed them to transform into monstrous giant scorpions upon reaching adulthood.
*   The Aresian monks use the island as a sacred trial ground, fighting the transformed centaurs to test their initiates and grant the cursed creatures a final peace.

The monks warned the party to avoid the Lotus Witch's tower, shared a simple meal with them, and asked them to check on their initiates, who were currently undergoing their trial inland. The party also confirmed their goal of acquiring a giant scorpion stinger and tail for the marid, Shazum.

### **Trial by Fire: The Scorpion's Oasis**

Following the path inland, the party was drawn by the sounds of battle to an ancient, scorpion-themed temple near an oasis. They discovered the Aresian initiates locked in a desperate fight against three **giant scorpions** , and they were losing badly.

The party charged into battle to aid the young warriors.
*   Aella used the silent path of her **Oathkeeper Chakram** to strike all three scorpions in a single devastating attack.
*   The combined might of the party and the remaining monks quickly dispatched two of the scorpions.
*   The largest of the creatures, a **Gargantuan Scorpion** , proved more resilient, grappling and killing one of the initiates before the party could intervene.
*   As the battle raged, the ground began to vibrate, heralding a new threat.

### **Session End & Next Steps**

The session ended on a cliffhanger. As the party fought the Gargantuan Scorpion, a new, even more terrifying creature crested a nearby sand dune: a colossal **Scorpion Matriarch** , covered in swarming baby scorpions, joining the fray to defend her brood.

The party will begin the next session in the middle of this dangerous encounter. Once the island's business is concluded, they have discussed traveling to the **Isle of the Fates** , guided by the Constellation of the Bard, to pursue Astraeus's epic path.
