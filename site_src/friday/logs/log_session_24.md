* Witnessed the ritual sacrifice of Queen Vytha's son.  
* Participated in the subsequent feast, consuming the ceremonial meal and gaining the benefits of a *Hero's Feast* (temporary HP, immunity to poison/fear, advantage on Wis saves).  
  **Quest Briefing & Preparation:**

  **Stealth & Combat:**
