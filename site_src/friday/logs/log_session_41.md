# **Quest Log: Session 41 \- The Serpent's Maw**

* **Finalized the Infiltration Plan:** After aerial reconnaissance confirmed that both the main beach and the port town were too heavily fortified for a direct approach, we devised a new strategy. The plan is to ambush a patrol, steal their uniforms and intelligence (passwords, patrol routes), and use the disguises to infiltrate the main fortress. To bypass the treacherous terrain, we had our Janken smiths fashion a set of harnesses, allowing our dragons to ferry us one by one over the island's mountainous ridges under the cover of darkness.  
* **Investigated the Stone Watchers:** Argon's reconnaissance revealed the nature of the island's unique alarm system: "Stone Watchers." These are massive gygan statues with bronze cages for heads, each containing two live harpies. Argon's keen senses discerned that while the harpies do not possess true sight, they have a preternatural ability to sense creatures within 60 feet, even those under the effects of invisibility. We resolved to keep our distance, knowing their song would alert the entire island.  
* **Established the Ambush Site:** Following our dragon-ferry plan, we established a staging area deep within the jungle. From there, Aella was dropped at a strategic fork in the road, where she cast *Pass Without Trace* to conceal our approach. The rest of the party was swiftly and silently ferried in, taking up positions in the dense undergrowth, carefully situated between two Stone Watchers but outside their 60-foot detection radius.  
* **Lying in Wait:** Hidden in the foliage, we observed the patrol approaching. Our target consists of a hardened soldier-captain, a centaur scout, six other soldiers of mixed Thylean races, two towering six-armed gygans, and a formidable gorgon whose metallic hooves sparked against the stones on the jungle path.  
* **Next Objective:** The patrol has entered our ambush zone, completely unaware of our presence. With the element of surprise, we are poised to strike. Delphi is preparing to initiate the attack with a *Hypnotic Pattern* to incapacitate as many foes as possible, allowing us to capture and interrogate survivors for the information vital to our infiltration.
