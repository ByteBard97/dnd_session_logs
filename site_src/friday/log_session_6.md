Notes:

* **Conclusion of the Battle with Demetria:**  
  * Resuming the intense combat in the feasting hall of the Mossy Temple, you faced Demetria, the vengeful dryad, and her formidable gygan guardian.  
  * **Aella** delivered a critical strike against Demetria, severely wounding her.  
  * **Delphi** swiftly cast a sleep spell, successfully rendering Demetria unconscious.  
  * Seeing an opportunity to avoid further bloodshed, **Astreus** used his silver tongue to persuade the gygan to lay down his arms and flee the battle.  
  * With the immediate threats neutralized, you securely tied up Demetria to prevent any further mischief.  
* **Retrieving the Horn of Balmytria:**  
  * **Delphi** retrieved the coveted **Horn of Balmytria** from the feasting table.  
  * Fulfilling one of your Great Labors, Delphi drank from the horn and immediately fell into a deep, dream-laden slumber.  
  * You recognized this as a sacred experience linked to your destiny.  
* **Exploration of the Mossy Temple:**  
  * While Delphi rested, the rest of you explored the remaining chambers of the temple.  
  * You discovered Demetria's private quarters, which contained a locked chest.  
  * Successfully picking the lock, you found valuable treasures, including coins, jewelry, and an ominous tome bound in human skin.  
  * Understanding the dark nature of the book, you decided to take it with you for proper disposal.  
* **Return to the Dragon Shrine:**  
  * With your mission in the Oldwoods complete, you escorted the rescued teenagers, including **Corinna** and **Sostrate**, back to Estoria.  
  * At the **Dragon Shrine**, you returned the Horn of Balmytria to **Aesop**, the shrine's keeper.  
  * Each of you participated in the sacred ritual of drinking from the horn, as required by your quest.  
  * Upon drinking, you all experienced vivid dreams of standing aboard a ghostly ship, the legendary **Ultros**, holding a mysterious bronze device resembling a compass.  
* **Interpreting the Visions:**  
  * Aesop helped interpret your dreams, explaining that the Ultros is a cursed ship captained by the infamous Dragonlord **Estor Arkelander**.  
  * The bronze device you saw is likely the **Antikythera**, a magical compass said to navigate any sea, including the mystical Forgotten Sea.  
  * These visions hinted at future challenges and the importance of seeking out the Ultros and the Antikythera.  
* **Addressing the Cursed Necklace:**  
  * Aesop informed **Delphi** that to lift the **curse of the graverobber**, the emerald necklace he carried must be returned to its rightful place in the **Necropolis at Telamok**.  
  * Understanding the urgency, you agreed to undertake this task to free Delphi from the curse.  
* **Disposing of the Evil Tome:**  
  * **Astreus** presented the sinister book found in Demetria's chambers to Aesop.  
  * Grateful for removing such a dangerous artifact from circulation, Aesop safely disposed of it.  
  * As a token of appreciation, he gifted Astreus a **potion of heroism**.  
* **Parley with the Centaurs:**  
  * Seeking a resolution to the looming threat against Estoria, you approached the centaur encampment under a flag of truce.  
  * You met **Baenor**, the centaur chieftain, who was leading the forces gathered north of the city.  
  * Baenor challenged you to single combat, offering a chance to deter the centaur assault if you proved victorious.  
  * He also proposed that you could offer yourselves as sacrifices to **Sydon** in place of **Princess Anora**.  
  * After deliberation, you declined both offers, recognizing the risks outweighed the potential benefits.  
* **Journey to the Necropolis at Telamok:**  
  * Deciding to pursue your next Great Labor, you set out for the Necropolis, a sacred burial site of the ancient Dragonlords.  
  * The journey took approximately six hours, leading you into the icy reaches of the **Mithral Mountains**.  
  * As you ascended the **Path of the Dead**, you prepared for dangers by plugging your ears with wax to guard against creatures that use enchanting songs.  
* **Encounter with the Harpies:**  
  * Along the narrow mountain path, you were ambushed by three harpies whose alluring songs could lure travelers to their doom.  
  * Thanks to your precautions, you resisted their enchantments and engaged them in combat.  
  * You successfully defeated the harpies, sending their bodies plummeting into the mist-filled chasms below.  
* **Meeting the Silent Guardian:**  
  * At the entrance of the Necropolis, a silent, skeletal guardian barred your passage.  
  * He extended a bony hand, demanding a **burnished coin of the Dragonlords** as payment to enter.  
  * Respecting the sacred traditions, you offered the coin, and he stepped aside, granting you entry.  
  * The guardian warned you that disturbing the tombs could invoke curses upon you.  
* **Lifting Delphi's Curse:**  
  * **Delphi** presented the cursed necklace to the guardian.  
  * The skeletal figure accepted it, returning it to its rightful place within the Necropolis.  
  * As a result, the curse afflicting Delphi was lifted, freeing him from its adverse effects.  
* **Exploration of the Necropolis:**  
  * You carefully navigated the ancient tombs, taking care not to disturb the resting places of the honored dead.  
  * The Necropolis was vast and solemn, each tomb a monument to the heroes of old.  
  * **Delphi** felt a profound connection to this place, seeking clues about his destiny as the **Vanished One**.  
  * **Raina**, remembering her path as the **Haunted One**, realized that interrogating Demetria might reveal vital information about her past and the mysteries that haunt her.
