### **Recap of Session 16: "Through the Storm and Shadows"**

* **The Descent from Mount Volkan:**  
  * After dispelling Sydon's hurricane with the power of the **Boreal Harp ** , the heroes began their descent from **Mount Volkan ** , a place steeped in divine significance as the namesake of **Volkan, the God of Forges** . The mountain's harsh cliffs and storms tested their resolve one last time.  
  * They stumbled upon the **nest of a wyvern pair ** , but their attempt to sneak past failed. The **female wyvern attacked ** , knocking **Aella ** down the mountainside and leaving her clinging to life. ** Rhena **, with the help of her dragon companion ** Nyssi**, took charge, delivering decisive blows to slay the creature.  
  * The fight grew deadlier when the **male wyvern returned ** . **Astreus ** narrowly avoided death after being thrown off a ledge, and the party fought desperately to survive. Finally, they emerged victorious, recovering a ** golden amulet ** and a ** wyvern egg**—a hard-won trophy of their courage.  
* **Return to Mytros:**  
  * The city of **Mytros ** lay battered but not broken as its people worked to recover from Sydon's storm. On the streets, the ** Cult of Lutheria** continued its efforts to sway the masses, distributing food and wine to the poor. Though their actions appeared charitable, the heroes knew their intentions were far darker.  
  * At the palace, **King Acastus ** greeted the party warmly, rewarding them with a ** map to the Ultros **, a legendary ship that could change the balance of power in Thylea. However, ** Queen Vallus ** privately warned the heroes of her husband's ambitions. She urged them to keep the ship out of his hands and gifted them a ** Scarab of Protection** as a token of her support.  
* **The Agora and the Great Menagerie:**  
  * In the bustling **Agora ** , the party sought to sell the **wyvern egg ** . At the **Great Menagerie ** , they encountered **The Collector** , a mysterious figure dealing in exotic creatures. Cages of rare and sorrowful beasts filled the area, reflecting the city's mix of wonder and cruelty.  
  * The heroes struck a deal, trading the egg for gold and the freedom of **Kaelon ** , a captured centaur. Kaelon's story of being abducted by slavers resonated deeply with **Rhena** , whose own family's fate remained shrouded in mystery. His freedom was a small but meaningful victory.  
* **Rest and Reflection:**  
  * With the day's trials behind them, the party found brief respite in the palace, thanks to **Queen Vallus's hospitality** . After cleaning up and taking a well-deserved rest, they began preparing for their next steps.  
* **The Temple of Lutheria:**  
  * Turning their attention to the **Temple of Lutheria ** in ** Stygian Row**, the group found it far more refined than its surroundings suggested. The cultists welcomed the poor with food and wine, using these gifts to draw new followers into their fold.  
  * Posing as new devotees, the party gained entry to the temple. **Delphi's familiar** scouted the wine cellar below, but locked doors and lingering mysteries forced the group to retreat and gather more information before acting further.  
* **The Satyr's Tail:**  
  * Seeking answers about the **Cult of the Snake ** , the group visited the shady tavern known as **The Satyr's Tail ** . Two grizzled brothers shared cryptic information about the cult and its leader, the **Lady of Coins** , who rules over the slums with an iron grip. The brothers' demeanor suggested they were not to be trusted.  
  * Meanwhile, **Astreus ** joined the tavern's performer, ** Fryxon **, in a musical duet that won the crowd's favor. Afterward, Fryxon warned the party to be wary of the brothers, who had deep ties to the ** Cult of the Snake** and their dangerous leader.
