# Session 28
## Deep into the Serpent's Den

Following your brutal victory over the regenerating marble guardians, your party—Aella, Delphi, Rhaena, Astraeus, and the steadfast Makaira, with Kyra diligently recording your exploits—stood at the threshold of the Sacred Temple, the very heart of the usurper queen's power on Themis. The air was thick with the weight of Aella's thirteen-year exile, her quest to reclaim her birthright burning in her eyes.

Aella, ever the keen-eyed leader, discerned the secret of the massive bronze door: a rotating mechanism bearing a hand-shaped imprint, a silent invitation to the brave. Through it, you descended into the earth, the pressure building in your ears with each spiraling step.

You emerged into a cavernous chamber, the air thick with the musky scent of reptiles. Here, two Amazon warriors stood guard, one methodically sharpening a cleaver, the other pacing. Behind bronze bars, enormous eight-legged basilisks rumbled contentedly, their reptilian eyes a chilling promise of petrification. After a quick respite to recover your strength, you decided against stealth, opting for a decisive strike. Astraeus, with his enchanting charisma, charmed one of the Amazon guards, Talia, turning her heart to his cause. The battle was swift and brutal; Aella, with her enchanted chakram, cut down the dwarf basilisk-keeper Nura and her companion. The monstrous basilisks, now neutralized under hastily thrown sailcloth, snarled in frustration.

With Talia charmed and bound, you extracted crucial intelligence. You learned of Commander Lyra, Queen Thesilea VI, and her sister Leia—all dwelling deeper within the complex. You discovered the existence of other prisoners: captured lizardfolk, the giant Jancan blacksmith Bront (Steros's father!), and most importantly, Darien, a childhood friend of Aella's and a high-ranking loyalist to the true queen, imprisoned for thirteen years. Talia also divulged the dark truth behind the marble statues outside: they are the petrified "favored sons of Lutheria," some born here, some shipwrecked, some gifts from afar, and some destined as fodder for the basilisks. You also learned of an underwater entrance, though its exact location remained a mystery. The fallen Amazon warriors were disposed of, tossed over the cliff, their bodies carried away by the waves, unwittingly taking vital keys with them.

Leaving the lovestruck Talia (gagged and bound to prevent her alerting anyone to your presence) behind, you proceeded deeper. The next bronze door proved a stubborn challenge, its lock resisting Aella's initial attempts. Even with Stimfay sent to scour the cliff face for Nura's discarded keys (a futile search), Aella's persistent lockpicking eventually yielded.

Beyond, a honeycomb-like tunnel reeked of stagnant water. Your heightened senses detected a subtle trap plate. As Aella cautiously investigated, thick, serpentine hydra heads erupted from the holes in the walls, snapping venomously! Aella narrowly evaded their lethal bites. Realizing the danger, Astraeus raced back to Talia, charming her once more to glean the password: "By the Grace of Lutheria." Whispering the blasphemous phrase, you felt a chilling resonance of Lutheria's power, a sickening echo of past nightmares, but the monstrous heads retreated, allowing passage.

Navigating around more hidden trap plates, you discovered a side passage leading to the Amazon Barracks. Astraeus, peeking in, confirmed two more Amazon warriors inside, idly playing cards. Without hesitation, you burst in. Rhaena's longsword carved down one warrior, while Aella's chakram, in a brutal arc, decapitated the other. Among the spoils, you found a necklace heavy with keys!

These keys opened the final, formidable door in the barracks, revealing a grim sight: a hallway lined with prison cells. Two lizardfolk prisoners pleaded for rescue, revealing their loyalty to Queen Vytha and mentioning the cyclops Bront's capture.

But the true revelation lay in the last cell: a young woman, scarred and silent. Recalling Talia's earlier mention of a high-ranking loyalist named Darien held prisoner for her allegiance to the true queen, Aella addressed the unresponsive figure. Despite Aella's impassioned revelation of her own true identity and her denouncement of the medusa usurpers' treachery, the woman remained eerily silent. Delphi, however, with his keen senses, noticed a peculiar acoustic anomaly in her cell, a subtle disturbance suggesting a magical silence was at play. With a final turn of a hard-won key, Aella opened Darien's cell. As the iron grated open, the young woman finally looked up, her eyes wide with a mixture of nervousness and fear.
