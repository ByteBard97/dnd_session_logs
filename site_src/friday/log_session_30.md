# Session 30 {#session-30}

### **Rescue & Alliances** {#rescue-&-alliances}

* **Darian Rescued:** The party freed Aella's childhood friend, Darian, from a magically-silenced prison cell, marking the first major step in reclaiming the throne.  
* **Allies Gained & Contained:** The captive lizardfolk, Skal and Veth, were freed. The charmed Amazon guard, Talia, was then imprisoned in Darian's former cell to keep her silenced.  
* **Arming for Vengeance:** The party looted the Amazon barracks, finding treasure (adamantine daggers, platinum), a sailor's map, and several strange items. They used the captured gear to arm the newly-freed Darian and healed her wounds.

### **Delving Deeper** {#delving-deeper}

* **Strange Encounters:** The party descended further, bypassing a mysterious cobalt-blue fountain and discovering a salon filled with a harem of dazed young men.  
* **A Demon's Tip:** In a ruined feast hall, the group met Voracia, a bored demon who, for her own amusement, pointed them toward the bedchamber of Leia, one of the medusa usurpers.  
* **The Lair of the Sister:** Avoiding a trap plate, the party found Leia's opulent room. Inside, the medusa was lounging with a minotaur companion, serenaded by a maenad musician, with the sound of crying infants coming from a nearby cradle.

### **The Ambush & The Twist** {#the-ambush-&-the-twist}

* **Perfect Assault:** The party launched a surprise attack, bursting in and quickly gaining the upper hand with a coordinated assault. Aella's chakram hit Leia, Rhaena's spear killed the minotaur, and magic from Astraeus and Delphi blasted the room.  
* **Petrifying Gaze:** The tide turned when Leia unleashed her power, instantly turning Astraeus and Delphi to stone.  
* **Deceit Revealed:** The "infants" in the cradle revealed their true forms as goatling tricksters. One of them polymorphed Makaira into a rat.

### **Victory from the Jaws of Defeat** {#victory-from-the-jaws-of-defeat}

* **Final Act of Power:** Just as all seemed lost, the stone-bound Delphi unleashed a final, maximized lightning bolt from a scroll, incinerating Leia and one of the goatlings.  
* **Reversal of Fortune:** With Leia's death, the polymorph spell on Makaira was broken. The remaining enemies, including the second goatling and the maenad musician, immediately surrendered.  
* **Restoration & Restocking:** The party used their last two doses of basilisk salve to cure Astraeus and Delphi. They then returned to the basilisk pens, killed the remaining beasts, and skillfully harvested a fresh supply of six doses of the petrification antidote.
