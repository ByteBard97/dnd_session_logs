## Friday Recap: The Tyrant's End

When last we left our heroes, they stood deep within the serpent's den, the Amazon temple on the island of Themis. With one of the medusa usurpers, Leia, already defeated, only the queen herself remained. You chose to press your advantage, formulating a daring plan to unmask the tyrant and reveal her monstrous nature to her followers.

With Aella's magic cloaking your movements, Astraeus turned invisible and slipped past the guards. As Queen Thessalia performed her profane rites to Lutheria, a single, spectral hand reached out and ripped the platinum helmet from her head, and a torrent of snakes erupted for all to see! Accusations flewâ€”Thessalia blamed you for a magical trick, while Aella and Darian revealed the truth of the coup that happened thirteen years prior. Darian's impassioned speech, empowered by Astraeus's magic, struck a chord with the Amazon warriors, who stood down in their confusion, refusing to fight for either side.

The battle was joined! Thessalia fought with the fury of a cornered snake, creating illusory duplicates of herself and unleashing a petrifying gaze that began to turn Delphi to stone. But you were relentless. Your combined assault shattered her illusions, and Delphi fought off the petrification with a successful save. When her last loyal attendant tried to heal her, Delphi's quick thinking with a *Counterspell* sealed her fate. Bested and broken, the queen offered surrender, but Aella denied mercy to her mother's murderer. In a final act of defiance, Queen Thessalia took her own life, her green blood staining the temple floor.

Though the tyrant is dead, the fight for the throne is not over. The Amazons' leader, Colonel Ilia, has issued a challenge: to prove her divine right to rule, Aella must slay the great Roc of the Forgotten Sea and present its head to the sisterhood.

Your victory yielded great rewards:

* You freed and de-brainwashed a group of captive men, several of whom have sworn to join your crew.  
  
* Rhaena, you have claimed a greater family heirloom: a magnificent, hovering chariot imbued with the magic of your ancestors.  
  
* Aella, you now wield the **Oathkeeper Chakram** , a deadly returning disc capable of unleashing a silent, vorpal path of destruction.  
  
* You rescued the famed Jancan blacksmith, Bront, and can reunite him with his son Steros aboard the *Ultros*.  
  
* And you have a new quest: the goatlings revealed that the queen fed a legendary sword to the temple's hydra, a prize that now waits in the belly of the beast.  
  

You have all gained a level for your heroic deeds. Now, with the tyrant dead, a new challenge laid before you, and new allies and treasures in hand, you stand ready to leave this bloody temple and continue your journey. Your next destination has been chosen: the island marked by the Constellation of the Centaur.
