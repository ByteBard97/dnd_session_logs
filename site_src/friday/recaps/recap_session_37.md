# Session 37: The Waking Dream of Dragons
*July 25, 2025*

---

When last we saw our heroes, you had returned to the impossible tower of the Lotus Witch, bearing three living dragon eggs—destinies waiting to be unhatched. The gynosphinx greeted you not with riddles, but with an air of profound ceremony. The time for questions was over. The **Ritual of Waking Dreams** was about to begin.

She bid you place the eggs in nests woven from moonlight and starlight. "These are not mere pets," she rumbled, "but destinies to be forged." As you gazed into the shells, the world dissolved into a silvery void. You stepped into a waking dream, your very souls becoming the loom upon which your companions' beings were woven.

**Astraeus**, you envisioned a cradle of knowledge for your silver dragon, its mind taking root in the hallowed halls of a **Mystical Academy**. You saw your years together not as scholar and subject, but as a whirlwind of **shared artistic creation**—your dragon the rumbling bass note in an epic poem, its elegant form the inspiration for a grand sculpture. You forged a bond of **equals**, two halves of a single, heroic whole.

**Delphi**, your bronze dragon was forged in the crucible of a **Chaotic Battlefield**, its spirit hardened by the brutal realities of war. Your years together were spent not in a single conflict, but on an endless road as true adventurers and survivors. You forged a bond of absolute **trust**, a quiet sanctuary from a harsh world, where you are each other's secret keeper and comfort.

**Rhaena**, you saw your silver dragon mature in the profound silence of a **Dangerous Wilderness**, its mind sharpened by the unforgiving lessons of survival. Your years together were a relentless montage of **martial training**, tempering its raw power into a weapon reflective of your own paladin code. You forged a primal bond, not as equals, but as **Guardian and Ward**—in its fierce loyalty, you found strength to face your own darkness, and in your sacred duty, it found safety.

The dream receded, and you found yourselves back in the tower as cracks spiderwebbed across the eggs. From them emerged not helpless wyrmlings, but magnificent young dragons. **Avia**, the bronze dragon, with a unique pattern of silver scales like a lightning bolt upon her chest, turned her gaze to Delphi. The playful silver dragon **Soraya** nudged Astraeus with a goofy affection. And Rhaena held her own silver dragon, **Argon**, a silent, powerful bond already formed.

But your triumph was met with a startling discovery. Stepping out of the tower, you found the sea empty. The *Ultros* was gone. Your new dragons took to the sky and soon spotted a familiar vessel on the horizon—the *Ultros*, sailing *towards* the island. You had been displaced in time again and were about to witness your own arrival.

To avoid a catastrophic paradox, you retreated into the island's shadows. For six days, you watched your past selves live out the events that had led you here. You used the time wisely—Delphi scribing powerful scrolls, and Astraeus mastering the Boreal Harp, his skill growing so potent it earned him a **permanent +1 bonus to his Performance skill**.

When your other selves finally entered the tower, your moment came. Boarding the *Ultros*, with Kyra smoothing over the crew's confusion, you set sail. Astraeus, now a master of the winds, played the harp for a full day, its magic propelling the ship at an impossible speed.

Your swift voyage brought you to the familiar shell of Jazirat Zulhaf, the Turtle Island. There, you completed your pact with the marid, Shazum, trading the giant scorpion's tail for the promised **Orb of Star Metal**. Intrigued by your tale of the Sphinx, he offered another trade: the story for a treasure. Your epic recounting earned you a **tarnished bronze coin**, a magical trinket that whispers secrets of the sea's temper.

Now, standing on the shores of that wandering sanctuary, with new companions, new power, and new treasures in hand, you look towards the horizon. The Isle of the Fates awaits.
