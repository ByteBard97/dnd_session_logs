### **Session 40: The Librarian's Gambit**

*Session 40 Recap - September 18, 2025*

With the Fates' grim bargains struck and your spirits heavy with their terrible prices, you returned to the wandering sanctuary of Jazirat Zulhaf. There, before the marid merchant Shazum, you presented the foul ichor scooped from the hags' pit. A masterful display of persuasion from Astraeus saw the vial traded not for an item, but for a king's ransom: nine thousand gold pieces.

But your business was not concluded. Shazum, impressed by your resourcefulness, offered a new, far more dangerous proposition. He spoke of the **Isle of Yonder**, the heavily fortified headquarters of your nemesis, Gaius, and his fanatical Order of Sydon. Within its walls lies the Great Library of the Gygans, and within that library, a tome of immense power: **'The Chronos Anvil.'** Shazum has tasked you with infiltrating the enemy fortress to "permanently borrow" this book, a feat of impossible subtlety and skill. For this, Astraeus drove another hard bargain, securing the legendary **Voidcaller Bow** upfront as a tool for the trials ahead.

As the *Ultros* cut through the waves toward the enemy isle, you spent your time preparing. Your dragons feasted upon magical fish, growing in size and power from the celestial energy of a **Stardust Koi** and the nether-essence of a deep-sea eel. Rhaena brewed potions to ward off the chill of the grave, while Delphi confronted Kyra with his restored memories, only to be met with an emotional silence, hinting at a secret she is forbidden to speak.

You arrived at Yonder under the cloak of night, a fortress-isle rising from the dark sea. A glimpse of a massive silver dragon in the moonlight confirmed the danger, and you wisely guided the *Ultros* into a hidden cove. To pierce the veil of the enemy's defenses, you sent forth an invisible scoutâ€”one of your own dragon companions.

Through your dragon's eyes, you witnessed the full might of the Order of Sydon. You saw the fortress, perched high atop a sheer cliff, its grounds swarming with patrols of disciplined soldiers, six-armed gygans, and captains mounted on metallic gorgons. You discovered their chilling alarm system: statues of giants with cages for heads, where live harpies sit as silent sentinels, ready to unleash their luring song upon any intruder. Your scout saw the horned, blue-skinned mage **Chondrus**, communing with sinister shadows within the library itself, and watched as Gaius's great silver dragon, **Argyn**, settled fitfully to rest in the central courtyard.

Now, hidden in the shadows of the cove, with the enemy's formidable strength laid bare before you, you must decide your next move. The fortress awaits. How will you breach its walls and steal the secrets of the Chronos Anvil?
