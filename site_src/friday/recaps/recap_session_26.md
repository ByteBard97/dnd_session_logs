# Session 26

Okay, heroes, let's relive the whirlwind of fire, scales, and strange shores from our last adventure\!

Having struck down the usurper King Jankor within his volcanic fortress, your path led deeper into the fiery mountain's heart. The final prize, the second Brass Dragon Egg, lay hidden within the sweltering cave of the salamanders, Ignis and Cindra. Testing the cracked, glowing floor proved perilous, as Astraeus discovered when his foot ignited upon contact\! Prudence demanded another approach.  

Harnessing potent magic, Delphi and Aella prepared potions of Spider Climb, while Astraeus invoked his enchanted lute to take flight. With Delphi scaling the walls like an arachnid, Astraeus floated into the cavern, confronting the protective salamanders. Wielding Jankor's captured *Staff of Thunder and Lightning*, Astraeus channeled newfound authority, mixing diplomacy with intimidation. Though wary, the salamanders yielded before the symbol of their fallen master and the party's demonstrated power, allowing you to claim the ancient Brass Dragon Egg – a key step in Delphi's path as the Vanished One. While there, Delphi also skillfully extracted several of the strange, humming red crystals embedded in the cave walls.  

Rallying your allies – the rescued Bloodscale warriors, the young dragonling Pyraxis (now fixated on the second egg and questioning Jankor's lies), and the eager Jancan smith Steros – you prepared to leave the smoldering fortress. A brief, unsettling encounter with the ancient, blind cyclops Polyphorus in his opulent chambers ended with you wisely declining his ominous arm-wrestling challenge after a quick consult with Steros.  

With the fortress explored and its treasures secured (including Jankor's secret lockbox ), you emerged into the jungle, guided back to the Bloodscale village. Queen Vytha hailed your victory, declaring the spoils of the fortress yours by right. But more than treasure, she offered an ancient blessing. As dawn broke, amidst drumming and Sessith's Draconic chants, Queen Vytha performed the Ritual of the Volcano's Heart. Anointing each of you with a paste of ash, scales, and moss, she drew symbols that surged with intense heat before settling into your skin, granting you the permanent Blessing of the Volcano's Heart – newfound resilience against fire.  

Returning to the *Ultros*, celebration mingled with new beginnings. Rhaena greeted Nissy, who returned bearing a gleaming Silver Dragon Egg\! Delphi's expertise revealed both his Brass Egg and Rhaena's Silver Egg would hatch in a mere fifteen days. Steros set about finding space for his forge and tools, agreeing to help construct an incubator. Meanwhile, the contents of Jankor's hidden lockbox were examined: a journal written in Draconic, a Potion of Fire Breath, a potent Scroll of Lightning Bolt, valuable gems, a sinister Obsidian Sacrificial Dagger, a suspicious Potion of Storm Giant Strength seemingly tainted by Sydon, and a heavy, pulsating obsidian geode trapping a fiendish entity.  

As you set sail, a Siren messenger delivered a crucial letter from Aesop, Keeper of the Dragon Shrine, revealing his suspicion that other ancient dragons might still live, captured by the Titans. Your journey then took you back to the wandering Jazirat Zul'Haf, the Turtle Island. There, you delivered the promised fire snake eggs to the delighted marid, Shazum. As reward, you chose the mysterious Orb of Star Metal. Shazum, ever the trader, tasked you with acquiring a Perfect Basilisk Eye from your next destination – Themis – offering a choice of magical items or gold in return. You bartered with him, selling the risky Sydon-touched potion and purchasing scrolls and the Crusher's Ring for Aella, while Delphi acquired an Elemental Mote. A brief stop at the Floating Lantern tavern introduced you to the shaken Captain Arion, who recounted a harrowing tale of giant birds and shipwreck near the Aerie of the Roc, providing valuable, if terrifying, intelligence about the Forgotten Sea.  

With the Antikythera set for the Constellation of the Twins, you finally arrived at Themis, the legendary island of the Amazons. Guided by the knowledgeable warrior Makhaira, Aella stepped onto her homeland after thirteen long years of exile. The vast grasslands stretched before you, beautiful yet tense. Initial aerial scouting by Aella's Stimfay revealed herds of strange creatures, rhino riders, basilisk hounds, scattered war camps, and, ominously, a small island in the eastern bay covered in statue-like figures – the likely heart of the usurpers' power.  

Now, standing on the shores of Themis, with allies at your side and enemies unknown lurking across the plains, your quest for allies and answers truly begins... What dangers and discoveries await on this island of warrior women?
