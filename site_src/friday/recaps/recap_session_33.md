## The Nightmare & The Scorpions

## **Session 33 Opening Recap**

*"As we return to our tale, the heroes of the Ultros find themselves in the midst of chaos and carnage on the treacherous shores of Scorpion Island...*

### **A Troubled Voyage: Lutheria's Nightmare**

As the *Ultros* sailed toward the island marked by the Constellation of the Centaur, the party was assailed by a shared, horrifying dream sent by the Titan, Lutheria. The vision depicted shipwrecked sailors succumbing to cannibalism on a desolate shore. The dream's potent magic overwhelmed both Astraeus and Delphi, who awoke consumed by a violent bloodlust, turning on their companions.

A chaotic struggle ensued below decks:
* Aella and Rhaena, having resisted the dream's influence, fought to restrain their friends without causing serious harm.
* Aella managed to grapple the frenzied Astraeus, while Rhaena attempted to subdue him with nets.
* The conflict was resolved when Rhaena, having attuned to the recently acquired **Titan's Scourge** , used its power to break the nightmare's hold on both affected party members.

### **Arrival at Scorpion Island**

Dawn brought relief as the nightmare's effects faded, and the party found themselves approaching a desolate, rocky island. The landscape was harsh and unwelcoming - jagged cliffs, sparse vegetation, and an ominous sense of danger pervading the air.

### **The Aresian Monks**

Upon landing, the party encountered a group of **Aresian monks** - followers of Ares, the god of war. These warrior-priests had come to the island seeking to prove their worth through combat trials. The monks shared crucial information:

* They described the **Lotus Witch's tower** as a "trial for heroes" - a test of courage and skill that few survive.
* The monks spoke of the island's dangerous wildlife, particularly the **giant scorpions** that gave the island its name.
* They warned of the witch's power and the many who had attempted to reach her tower but never returned.
* The monks revealed they had been on the island for several days, gradually working their way toward the tower while battling the island's creatures.

### **The Scorpion Assault**

As the conversation with the monks continued, the party was suddenly attacked by a swarm of **giant scorpions** emerging from the rocky terrain. The battle was fierce and chaotic:

* Multiple **Large Giant Scorpions** emerged from hiding spots among the rocks.
* The creatures used their powerful claws and venomous stingers to deadly effect.
* Several of the Aresian monks were caught off guard and fell to the scorpions' assault.
* The party fought valiantly alongside the surviving monks, using their combined skills and magic to battle the arachnid menace.

### **The Matriarch Arrives**

Just as the party seemed to be gaining the upper hand against the giant scorpions, the situation took a dire turn. A **massive Scorpion Matriarch** - easily the size of a building - emerged from deeper within the island's rocky terrain. This colossal creature dwarfed the other scorpions, its presence immediately shifting the balance of the battle.

The session ended with this terrifying new threat bearing down on the party and the few surviving monks, its massive claws and stinger promising devastation. The heroes now face their greatest challenge yet on this cursed island, with the Lotus Witch's tower still distant and the path forward blocked by this monstrous guardian.

*The fate of the party hangs in the balance as they prepare to face the Scorpion Matriarch in what may be their most dangerous battle yet...*
