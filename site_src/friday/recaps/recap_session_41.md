### **When Last We Met...**

The full might of the Order of Sydon’s fortress on Yonder lay revealed before you. Through the eyes of your invisible dragon scout, you had seen the sheer cliffs, the swarming patrols, and the great silver dragon Argyn coiled at the heart of the enemy's power. You had discovered their insidious alarm system: the Stone Watchers, giant statues crowned with cages, each imprisoning live harpies whose supernatural senses could pierce even magical stealth.

Rejecting a suicidal direct assault, you devised a plan of infiltration. Your Janken smiths forged ingenious harnesses, turning your dragon companions into a silent ferry in the night, a way to bypass the island’s treacherous mountain ridges. Your target: a heavily armed patrol, from whom you would take uniforms, intelligence, and a path into the fortress itself.

You were carried through the darkness to a fork in a jungle path, a perfect ambush site nestled between the watchful gaze of two distant Stone Watchers. Aella shrouded your party in a veil of silence with *Pass Without Trace*, and you melted into the dense undergrowth, becoming ghosts in the humid air.

Which brings us to now.

You lie hidden in the foliage, the air thick with the smell of damp earth and the thrumming of insects. Through the broad leaves, you see them. A hulking gorgon, its bronze scales catching the torchlight, snorts steam as its hooves spark against the stones. At its flanks march two towering gygans, their six arms bristling with weapons. Behind them, a hardened centaur, a captain in a crested helm, and a squad of soldiers march with wary discipline, completely unaware. They have just walked into the serpent's maw.

The enemy is in your kill-zone. Delphi, your fingers crackle with arcane power, ready to unleash a wave of hypnotic light. The jungle holds its breath. The attack is yours to begin. What do you do?
