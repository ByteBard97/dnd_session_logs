# Session 35

When last we left our heroes, you stood before the impossible Tower of the Lotus Witch, a seamless black spire surrounded by a deadly enigma. Your experiments had revealed the terrifying truth of the golden wildflowers at its base—a field where time itself was broken, aging all who entered to dust in mere seconds. With the fate of the cursed centaurs resting on your shoulders, a choice had to be made.

With courage befitting a Dragonlord, Delphi stepped forward. Tying a rope around his waist as a lifeline to his friends, he plunged into the temporal chaos. For him, the world dissolved into a dizzying blur of madly spinning suns and stars. For you, he simply vanished. Following his ghostly trail, the rest of you braved the field, reuniting before a door that had mysteriously appeared in the tower's obsidian face.

The path led not to a monster's lair, but to a place far more unsettling: a nursery. Here, dozens of children—human, elf, minotaur—played amongst the discarded armor and weapons of their former lives, their minds wiped clean, their bodies de-aged by the tower's cruel mistress. They warned you of the "flower lady's" disappointment with uninvited guests and urged you to climb to the summit to face her with respect.

Your ascent was a journey through wonders and horrors. You passed a museum of ancient beasts and fallen warriors, a chamber humming with the power of a grand summoning portal, and a room of windows that looked out upon other worlds—vistas of heaven, hell, and the starry void between.

Finally, at the tower's peak, you met her. Seated upon a carved stone platform, with the body of a lioness, the wings of an eagle, and the ancient, knowing eyes of a woman, was the Lotus Witch. The magnificent gynosphinx, intrigued by your quest and the presence of a true Dragonlord, offered a bargain. She would share her knowledge, but only if you could prove yourselves worthy.

And so her game began—a battle of wits with your very identities on the line. Answer three of her four riddles of Thylean history, and she would reveal the secrets you seek. Fail, and you would join the lost children in the nursery below, your adventures forgotten, your minds returned to infancy.

You met her first challenge, correctly naming the cruelest of the Dragonlords: the ghostly captain of your own ship, Estor Arkelander. You answered her second, recalling the name of the first and greatest Dragonlord, the noble Xander. Two questions down, two correct. The path to victory seemed clear.

But now, you face her third riddle. "When Thylea bore fruit," the Sphinx's voice echoes in the chamber, "which two Titans sprang forth from a single pit?" The air is thick with tension. One wrong answer could spell your doom. The Lotus Witch watches, her expression unreadable, as you weigh the fate of your quest on the tip of your tongue...
