# Session 36: The Sphinx's Bargain and the Spirits' Release

When last we left our heroes, you stood at a precipice, not of knowledge, but of oblivion. Before the ancient and powerful Lotus Witch, two of her deadly riddles had been answered, but the third hung in the air, a razor's edge between wisdom and a childlike eternity in the nursery below. "Which two Titans sprang forth from a single pit?" she had asked. The fate of your quest, and your very minds, rested on the answer.

After a tense deliberation, pooling your fragmented memories and trusting Kyra's knowledge of the stars, you spoke the names: **Sydon and Lutheria**. A brilliant flash from the hieroglyphs confirmed your victory! Emboldened, you gambled on a fourth question for a bonus favor and won again, correctly naming the titan **Talius** as the creator of the Myrmekes.

Having proven your worth, the Sphinx opened her mind to you, a fount of ancient secrets. She revealed the path to **Astraeus's** grimoire, hidden on the dangerous **Isle of Yonder**. For **Delphi** and **Rhaena**, she refused to unnaturally age their dragon eggs, but offered a greater gift: a promise to oversee their hatching, to bring forth not mere wyrmlings, but powerful young dragons. But her counsel came with harsh truths; she scornfully dismissed a plea for the centaurs, revealing their curse was an eternal, and perhaps just, punishment. Her most crucial guidance, however, laid bare the grim choice for the spirit-filled lockbox you carried: to be a butcher, a thief, or a hero.

You chose the hero's path. After stepping from the tower's temporal distortion and discovering six days had passed, you returned to the *Ultros*. Under the eerie light of the astral sky, you performed a solemn ritual to release the souls trapped within the box. One by one, you offered the restless spirits the peace they were so long denied. **Kyra's** lament gave voice to their sorrow, **Astraeus's** epic poetry promised them remembrance, **Delphi's** prayer guided them to the afterlife, **Rhaena's** paladin's oath gave them justice, and **Aella's** warrior's salute granted them honor.

The ritual was a triumph. As the last of the Gygans, Amazons, and Centaurs faded into the moonlight, their rage finally quieted, the oppressive cold lifted. And there, inside the now-silent box, nestled in a fine, silvery dust, was your final prize: a magnificent, opalescent **silver dragon egg**, which began to pulse with a warm, living light.

Now, with three dragon eggs in hand and a course charted by the stars and a sphinx's wisdom, you prepare to return to the tower. The Lotus Witch awaits, ready to midwife the birth of dragons, as your journey steers you toward the even greater mysteries of the Fates and the dangers of Yonder.
