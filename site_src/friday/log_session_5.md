Notes:  
 **Continuing the Exploration of the Mossy Temple:**

* Determined to recover the **Horn of Balmytria** and thwart Demetria's sinister plans, you pressed deeper into the ancient temple.  
  **Encounter with Vine Blights and Gargoyles:**  
* In the temple's entrance hall, you faced **animated vine blights ** and two imposing ** gargoyles**.  
  * The gargoyles sprang to life when you didn't offer coins to the statues' outstretched bowls.  
* After a tough battle, you emerged victorious.  
* Took a **short rest** (your second of the day) to recover and tend to your wounds.  
  **Descending into the Depths:**  
* Ventured down a **dark stairwell** leading beneath the temple.  
* The air grew cooler and the walls echoed with distant, unsettling sounds.  
* You sensed that greater dangers awaited below.  
  **Rescuing Sostrate from the Goatlings:**  
* In a cavern illuminated by faint luminescent fungi, you found **Sostrate** , one of Corinna's missing friends.  
* He was being tormented by a group of malicious **goatlings** .  
* Engaged the goatlings in combat and successfully rescued Sostrate.  
* **Sostrate and Corinna ** decided to help other enchanted teenagers in the ** Cavern of Fungus** (T9), hoping to break Demetria's spell over them.  
  **Allied with Loreus the Satyr:**  
* **Loreus ** , the smitten satyr enamored with **Aella** , continued to assist you.  
* Attempted to **charm the gygan** , Demetria's formidable guardian.  
* However, **Demetria countered by charming Loreus** , momentarily turning him against you.  
  **Stealth Approach to the Feasting Hall:**  
* Opted to **sneak down the hallway** directly to the feasting hall, bypassing other rooms to confront Demetria swiftly.  
* Moved carefully to avoid alerting any additional guards or creatures.  
  **Confrontation in the Feasting Hall:**  
* Entered the grand feasting chamber where **Demetria** was preparing a dark ritual.  
* Four human girls sat around a lavish table, about to partake in a meal of **tainted human flesh** , unaware of its true nature.  
* **Astreus ** used his powers of persuasion to ** convince the girls not to eat**, revealing the gruesome truth.  
  * His words broke through Demetria's enchantment, and the girls fled in horror.

  **Battle with Demetria and the Gygan:**

* Furious at the disruption of her ritual, Demetria shed her facade of hospitality.  
* Commanded her six-armed **gygan** ally to attack you.  
  * The gygan wielded multiple weapons, presenting a significant threat.  
* **Loreus** , under Demetria's charm, posed an additional challenge.  
* The battle was intense, testing your skills and teamwork.  
* The session concluded **immediately after the gygan's turn** in the initiative order, leaving the combat at a critical juncture.  
  **Current Situation and Cliffhanger:**  
* You are **engaged in a fierce battle** against Demetria and her gygan guardian.  
* The fate of the remaining enchanted teenagers and the **Horn of Balmytria** hangs in the balance.  
* Your next actions will determine whether you can defeat Demetria, reclaim the horn, and fulfill one of your **Great Labors** .  
  **Key Points to Remember for Next Session:**  
* **Demetria ** is a powerful ** dryad** with dangerous magic and a deep-seated vendetta against mortals.  
* The **gygan** is a formidable opponent due to his multiple arms and combat prowess.  
* **Loreus** may still be under Demetria's charm, so be cautious of his actions.  
* Utilizing strategy and perhaps finding a way to break Demetria's control over Loreus could turn the tide of battle.  
* Time is of the essence to save any remaining teenagers and prevent Demetria from enacting further dark rituals.
