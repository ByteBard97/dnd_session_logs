# Session 13

Agenda

* **Aella:** Gather allies and return to the Isle of Themis and overthrow the usurpers who murdered your mother and stole her throne  
* **Astreus:** Seek out the Wisdom of Queen Vallus in Mytros to further your quest for knowledge  
* **Delphi:** Xander gave you your crown and his mystic armaments. Your fabled armor has been stolen by Gaius, the commander of the Order of Sydon. He keeps your armor in his fortress on the Island of Yonder, which is heavily fortified.  
* **Rhaena:** You have recovered your family ring, a lost artifact tied to your erased past. The whispers of your Mother urge you onwardâ€”to seek the greater family artifact held by the Amazon Queen, somewhere in the Cerulean sea.  
* **Party:** Estoria is under siege by a formidable centaur army demanding the sacrifice of Princess Anora to appease the Titan Sydon. You have agreed to stand in the place of Princess Anora as a sacrifice to Sydon. You have cleverly slain the fiendish basilisks in their cave and now must survive tomorrow night, chained to the rock of Estor.   
* **Party:** Recover Pythor's Hammer from King Pythor and then Volkan can use it to repair your damaged items

Log

* We started by going to the dragon shrine to heal aella.   
* Aesop the cleric agrees to attempt a healing ritual on Aella for 150gp, but he needs 100gp worth of diamond dust to perform the ritual  
* We head to the Agora to buy diamond dust  
* On our way there, dragon knights of Mytros fly down from the sky and land in the public square to the astonishment of everyone. they said that king acastus of mytros requires our presence as soon as possible at the palace in mytros. There is a big hurricane threatening the city with Sydon as its author.   
* Delphi detects some hidden deeper meaning in the knights' summons.  
* We return to the basilisk cave and burnt the bodies and buried the remains so that nobody will find them or notice them missing.  
* The acolytes of Sydon lead us to the rock of estor as the sacrifice ceremony begins. Weare chained at the ankle to the rock of Estor.  
* The sun is going down and three harpies fly out of the sky and attack\!  
* Delphi succumbs to their magical song and is charmed.  
* Delphi's owl familiar attacks delphi and uncharms him from the harpies' song.  
* The party throws rocks and Astreus opens his mouth and shoots beams of eldritch energy like 80's dune hitting the harpies as they swoop out of the sky and attack the party.  
* They defeat the harpies and no basilisks show up.  
* Gaius and the acolytes of Sydon are very disappointed. When the next morning comes, they have to free the heroes and admit that the terms of the deal have been fulfilled.  
* The centaur army gradually starts packing up and leaving  
* The next morning the heroes are victorious  
* Pythor celebrates with the heroes and gives them his hammer  
* Pythor swears an oath of service to the party because we sacrificed the huge boar to him earlier in our adventures.  
* Volkan offers to repair the heroes damaged items with Pythor's hammer at the mithral forge and he sets out there to reaquaint the forgekeeper Pyra  
* Pythor has declared a week of feasting and celebration in the heroes honor  
* We leave right away to go to Mytros in the company of the Knights of Mytros  
* We arrive outside the gates and there is a huge hurricane\!  
* From the clouds we can see the angry visage of Sydon and he throws a huge lightning bolt down at our feet. We barely leap out of the way in time and several party members are injured\!  
* An air elemental emerges from the impact crater and immediately attacks\!  
* It is resistant to Aella's spinning chakram attacks and Delphi shoots lightning bolts at it which it also resists. It attacks Kyrah and she pulls out a wicked looking dagger and stabs it in the back as it flies away toward Astreus.  
* Finally the creature sucumbs to the multiple blows of the party and dissipates\!  
* We enter the city and all the people are inside out of the path of the storm  
* Some guards tell us how to get to the palace.  
* We enter the throne room and it is opulent. Over on the side of  the throne room is a huge silver dragon sitting on a pile of silver coins.
