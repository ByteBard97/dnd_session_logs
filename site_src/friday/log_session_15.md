# Session 15

Agenda

* **Aella:** Gather allies and return to the Isle of Themis and overthrow the usurpers who murdered your mother and stole her throne  
* **Astreus:** Queen Vallus has guided you to seek out the Lotus Witch, who may possess the fabled grimoire you need for your chronicles. She also suggested consulting the Fates, who could craft an artifact to help ensure you live to tell your tale.  
* **Delphi:** Xander gave you your crown and his mystic armaments. Your fabled armor has been stolen by Gaius, the commander of the Order of Sydon. He keeps your armor in his fortress on the Island of Yonder, which is heavily fortified.  
* **Rhaena:** You have recovered your family ring, a lost artifact tied to your erased past. The whispers of your Mother urge you onward—to seek the greater family artifact held by the Amazon Queen, somewhere in the Cerulean sea.  
* **Party:** Find out what is causing the storm over Mytros and investigate the goings on in the great city

Log

 **A Morning of Farewells**

* The party awoke well-rested in Boreas' villa, the storm-muted vineyard offering a brief reprieve from the chaos outside.  
* After intense negotiations, Boreas agreed to trade the Boreal Harp for Astreus's magical lute, an exchange that cemented mutual respect between the party and the satyr.  
* Evelina and Boreas bid the party farewell with a mixture of gratitude and caution, urging them to be safe in the storm-ravaged world beyond the vineyard's magical protection.  
  **Return to the Storm**  
* As the party trekked back through the hurricane-swept vineyards into Mytros, the storm's fury surged. Torrential downpours and gale-force winds made every step an arduous battle.  
* The streets of Mytros were a flooded maze. Slogging through the Temple District, the party passed the royal palace, its stoic walls battered by Sydon's wrath.  
  **A Heroic Rescue in the Chaos**  
* Along their path, the party came upon a collapsed home. Muffled cries from beneath the rubble spurred them into action.  
* Delphi used his magic to clear debris while the rest of the party dug through the wreckage. Their efforts inspired nearby neighbors, who joined in to pull the survivors to safety.  
  **The Impassable Steps**  
* The path to Mount Volkan's summit was blocked by a mudslide, forcing the party to detour through **Stygian Row** , the city's slums.  
* There, they discovered a man turned to stone. Using their magical ointment, they restored him, and he warned them about the Cult of the Snake, led by the enigmatic Lady of Coins.  
* He pointed them toward the Satyr's Tail, a seedy watering hole where they could learn more about this mysterious faction. The party marked it on their map before continuing north.  
  **The Treacherous Ascent**  
* The climb up Mount Volkan proved perilous, with rockslides threatening to sweep the party away.  
* A falling boulder injured Kyrah, who smashed her ankle but waved off the party's concerns, determined to see the mission through.  
  **The Ritual at the Summit**  
* At the mountain's peak, the party reached the storm-battered arena of the Great Games.  
* Kyrah provided instruction for the ritual, cautioning that Sydon would not sit idly by as they attempted to break his storm.  
* With the Boreal Harp in hand, Astreus began the minute-long ritual to counter the storm.  
  **Sydon's Wrath**  
* As the harp's magic began to weave, Sydon sent his forces to disrupt the ritual. Elementals of wind and water descended, along with storm-touched beasts and zealous servants of the Lord of Storms.  
* The party fought valiantly, protecting Astreus while he performed the delicate ritual. The battle was fierce, with Sydon's fury shaking the very mountain, but the heroes emerged victorious.  
  **A Triumph Against the Storm**  
* With a final, resonant chord from the Boreal Harp, the ritual was complete. The skies began to clear, and Sydon's storm was driven back, saving Mytros from destruction.  
* Kyrah congratulated Astreus on his flawless performance, her pride evident despite her injury. She declared this victory one that bards would sing of for generations.  
  **A Moment of Reflection**  
* The storm now abated, the party stood atop Mount Volkan, their weary faces illuminated by the first rays of sunlight breaking through the clouds. They had done what many thought impossible—defied a Titan and given Mytros hope.
