# Session 18

Agenda

* **Aella:** Gather allies and return to the Isle of Themis and overthrow the usurpers who murdered your mother and stole her throne  
* **Astreus:** Queen Vallus has guided you to seek out the Lotus Witch, who may possess the fabled grimoire you need for your chronicles. She also suggested consulting the Fates, who could craft an artifact to help ensure you live to tell your tale.  
* **Delphi:** Xander gave you your crown and his mystic armaments. Your fabled armor has been stolen by Gaius, the commander of the Order of Sydon. He keeps your armor in his fortress on the Island of Yonder, which is heavily fortified.  
* **Rhaena:** You have recovered your family ring, a lost artifact tied to your erased past. The whispers of your Mother urge you onwardâ€”to seek the greater family artifact held by the Amazon Queen, somewhere in the Cerulean sea.  
* **Party:**   
  * We will try to find a way to get into the basement of the Lutheria's Temple  
  * Moxena (the Lady of Coins) has tasked us with bringing her the head of Lord Neurdagon to show her our loyalty  
  * We have the map to the Ultros near The Dead Falls. We must recover it to continue our adventure

Log

* We end our visit with Moxena and her minotaur thugs show us out through the sewer entrance to the statue  
* We exit near the dockyard and make our way to the Neurdagon estate. We scout the place and debate our strategy for assassinating Lord Neurdagon  
* We decide to wait to slay him and make our way to the Thalia's Elixers  
* We buy three packets of dust of disappearance and notice the Ooze creature that Thalia has for sale  
* We decide to purchase the arcane creature and the magical jug that allows us to command it  
* Then we go to the temple of Lutheria and send out Delphi's owl to cause a distraction inside the temple  
* We pour the dust of disappearance on ourselves and sneak inside the temple  
* We lockpick the door down to the basement, but the cultists opens it for us in order to grab a crossbow to shoot down the owl. He opens the door for us and we sneak inside without anyone noticing  
* Down into the "wine cellar" and we are still invisible.  
* Our presence seems to agitate several shadows, creatures who haunt this area. They search around for but cannot find us because we are invisible, we leave the room and shut the door  
* Up the hallway we encounter a powerful looking acolyte. She appears to be guarding a prison like reinforced door.  
* Aella steals the woman's black sword and while invisible and draws her attention  
* The party attacks the woman while invisible, getting the drop on her wounding her greatly.  
* The woman unlocks the reinforced door and shuffles into the next room and everything is silent when that happens
