Log  
**Arrival at the Great Falls of Arkelon**

* The party reached the breathtaking **Great Falls of Arkelon**, where the river cascades into a vast lake surrounded by colossal statues known as the **Hands of Kentimane**, the Elder Titan.  
* As they marveled at the sight, they noticed **disgusting troglodytes** climbing a rope ladder along the waterfall's side.  
  **Clash at the Waterfall**  
* Without hesitation, the heroes engaged the troglodytes in a fierce battle on the slippery cliffs beneath the roaring waterfall.  
* One troglodyte escaped inside the caves, sounding an alarm that brought more creatures rushing to the fray.  
* A full-scale skirmish erupted at the cave entrance, but the party held their ground.  
  **Venturing into the Troglodyte Caves**  
* Entering the **foul-smelling caverns**, the heroes were assaulted by an overwhelming stench.  
* Navigating the dark tunnels, they remained vigilant for ambushes from troglodytes known to camouflage against the cave walls.  
  **Rescue of the Captured Centaurs**  
* They stumbled upon a horrific scene: a centaur being **cooked alive over a pit** by several troglodytes.  
* Swiftly defeating the beasts, the heroes saved two centaurs, **Kaluk** and **Hirak**.  
  * **Hirak** was near death but was revived with **goodberries** provided by the party.  
* The grateful centaurs warned of the **intelligent troglodyte king** deeper within the caves and cautioned about the creatures' chameleon-like abilities.  
* Before departing to reunite with their tribe, they reminded the heroes to **blow the ivory horn** upon leaving to receive their promised reward.  
  **Stealthy Assaults and Cave Navigation**  
* **Aella** took the lead, stealthily moving through the darkness and **silently eliminating two troglodytes** with her chakram.  
* The party carefully navigated the winding passages, aware of potential ambushes and traps set by the cunning creatures.  
* **Delphi's** keen senses and magical prowess aided in detecting hidden enemies.  
  **Confrontation with the Troglodyte King**  
* Deep within the caverns, Aella discovered the **troglodyte king**, a towering figure wearing a **golden circlet**—a headband that granted him unnatural intelligence.  
* Seizing the moment, she attacked from the shadows, wounding him severely.  
* The enraged king summoned his minions, and a tense battle ensued.  
* **Delphi** cleverly cast a **web spell**, blocking two pathways and preventing reinforcements from overwhelming the party.  
  **The Riddle Challenge**  
* Recognizing the stalemate, the troglodyte king proposed a contest:  
  * If the heroes could answer his **three riddles**, he would surrender his **mithral scepter**, grant them safe passage into the dwarven mines, and share a valuable secret.  
  * Accepting the challenge, the party listened intently and, through teamwork and wit, **correctly answered all three riddles**.  
* True to his word, the king handed over the scepter and revealed the secret:  
  * The **dwarven elevator ahead was trapped** and required the dwarvish password "**Barazgul**" (meaning "mithral") to deactivate the deadly mechanisms.

  **A Tense Departure and Moral Conflict**

* As the heroes prepared to leave, Aella noticed the king's **smug smirk**, suspecting deceit.  
* Feeling disrespected, she **demanded the rest of his treasures**.  
* Reluctantly, the king surrendered his gold and mithral ingots but **refused to part with his magical circlet**.  
* **Kyra** warned that breaking their agreement could damage their reputation and **erode trust among allies**.  
  **Rest and Reflection**  
* Outside the caves, the party took a **short rest** to recuperate.  
  * **Delphi attuned to the scepter**, which emitted a mysterious black glow in the fading light.  
* They contemplated the moral implications of their actions, weighing the pursuit of justice against the value of honor.  
  **Exploring the Upper Levels of the Mithral Mines**  
* Re-entering the caves, they noticed that the **two-headed dog statue** that once guarded a stone bridge was **no longer there**.  
* Sending **Delphi's owl familiar** ahead, they observed:  
  * A **great chasm** plunging into the earth—the **Deep Shaft** leading to the lower mines.  
  * **Death dogs**—vicious two-headed hounds—gnawing on the **corpse of a massive three-headed cerberus**, hinting at the deadly creatures that now inhabited the mines.  
  * An **ornate bronze elevator of dwarven construction**, adorned with intricate engravings and ancient craftsmanship.  
* The owl spotted a **hastily scribbled note in dwarvish** near the elevator but couldn't get close enough to read it.
