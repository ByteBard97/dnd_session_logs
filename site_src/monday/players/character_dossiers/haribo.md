### **1. Who Are You? Haribo the Spreader, Knight of the Musca**


### **2. What Drives You? We must spread the Musca as far as we can.**


### **3. What Shapes Your Beliefs? While we each have a very short time in this world, it is our combined efforts that move us forward.**


### **4. What Makes You Unique? I am the second eldest of our Musca and as such the only one able to produce the sporeno of our Musca.**


### **5. What Is Your Past? I was the Spore Guard of our musca until the great release of Dodus, the past musca Leader. Now that Uulk, the previous Spreader, is the Musca Leader, I am now the Spreader.**


### **6. What Do You Carry? I carry a handheld impression tool for marking territory claimed by the Musca.**


### **7. How Do You Interact? Haribo sees the world as a binary; areas under our control and areas that are not. Creatures are seen in a similar way. Those who could can help spread the Musca and those who slow the growth of the Musca.**


### **8. What Are Your Relationships? We are bound to each other through the Musca. The Musca can transmit limited information via Spore releases. Through an agreement with the T’Alzar our Musca is spared their expanse and in exchange we offer assistance in their exploits outside the Musca (which we use as an opportunity to spread Musca).**


### **9. What’s Your Flaw? The urge to spread the Musca can often overwhelm the Myconid mind and create unpredictable actions in environments ideal for the Musca growth. This distraction will quickly dispel once Spores have been spread in that location.**


### **10. What’s Your Arc? In the short life of a Myconid their goal is to travel as far as reasonable to stretch the reach of the Musca. Establishing new fungal colonies.**

**Character Development Worksheet**

*Answer these prompts to breathe life into your character and create memorable roleplaying moments at the table.*


### **1. Core Concept**

Sum up your character in five words or less. Think of this as your character's "elevator pitch."

One for all, All for one.


    Example: "Disgraced knight seeking redemption" or "Cunning merchant with dark past"


### **2. Two Driving Forces**

List two things your character wants - one immediate goal and one long-term ambition. These should sometimes conflict with each other.



* Immediate Goal: Upholding the bargain established with the T’Alzar to protect the Musca.
* Long-term Ambition: Creating as many Musca Colonies as possible while away from the Musca.

    Example: Immediate - Find their missing sister; Long-term - Restore their family's noble status



### **3. Defining Belief**

Complete this sentence: "I believe the musca will be triumphant because we hold our colonies above ourselves" This should connect to your character's backstory and guide their actions.


    Example: "I believe everyone deserves a second chance because I was given one when I needed it most."


### **4. Character Voice**

Write down:



* A unique phrase or saying your character often uses: We should have a colonie here
* A specific mannerism or habit they display: The dispersal of Spores in an ideal locations

    Example: Always touches their lucky coin before making important decisions



### **5. Bonds & Connections**



* Name one NPC who matters to your character (friend, mentor, or rival): Uulk is the Musca Leader and the guide of our Musca
* How does your character know one other PC in the party?: The Musca has met with the T’Alzar Family many times in the past for various works.

    Example: Served in the same military unit as another PC



### **6. Greatest Pride & Darkest Fear**



* What achievement makes your character most proud?: Spreading spores in an ideal location. The more ideal, the greater the victory.
* What keeps them awake at night?: The conveyance of information via spores can not be ignored and can keep a Myconid awake regardless of how minute the information.

    Example: Pride - Saving their village from bandits; Fear - Drowning after a near-death experience



### **7. The Unexpected Twist**

Add one trait that breaks the stereotype of your character's race, class, or background: Haribo likes to collect fungus that is not part of the Musca.


---


    Example: A barbarian who writes poetry, or a rogue afraid of the dark


### **8. Daily Life**



* What was your character's occupation before adventuring?: Spore Guard of the Musca and protector of the realm.
* What hobby or interest might surprise others?: Collects fungus and treats them like pets.

    Example: A cleric who collects exotic cooking recipes



### **9. Unresolved Story**

What aspect of your character's past remains unresolved?

Haribo has always pondered the creation of the Musca and if out in the world exists another Musca like his own.


    Example: A debt unpaid, a promise unkept, or a mystery unsolved


### **10. Growth Potential**

What weakness or flaw would your character like to overcome during their adventures? If a new AND better location can be found for the Muca we might be able to escape the dependency on the T’Alzar for safety.
