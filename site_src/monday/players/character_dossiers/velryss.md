**Velryss’s Backstory**  
   
Velryss T'alzar is a Wizard who fights like a duelist, thinks like a tactician, and speaks like a performer on stage. His dramatic flair, razor wit, and reputation for scandal aren't weaknesses—they're calculated assets. His flamboyant persona isn't just a personal preference, but a strategic mask—a decoy and weapon forged for a singular purpose: To draw attention away from the house's real vulnerabilities. He wears silk and sarcasm like armor. While others plot in silence or strike in shadow, Velryss steps into the spotlight—so others don't have to. This role isn't self-imposed. It was crafted under the eyes of his Aunt and Teacher, Matron Severine T'alzar, the house's ruthless and brilliant leader. She saw in Velryss not a soldier or priest, but a weapon of spectacle—one that could shift attention, destabilize enemies, and protect the family's interests with words, illusions, and deadly grace. He honed this craft under her instruction, learning how to move through noble courts and violent alleys with equal poise. From dueling Sergeant Vex in a crowded square to intentionally starting a tavern brawl as a diversion, Velryss has embraced the role of the "fool with a blade"—knowing full well it is all by design

**The Mask and What he brings to the Team**

He smiles while enemies underestimate him. He spins words and blades with equal grace. He makes you laugh while stealing your attention from something far more dangerous.

 "They think I dance for attention. I dance so they don't see the knife. Or the spider behind it.

**Bladesinger in the House of Blades**   
While his peers pursued the divine path of Lolth, Velryss sought something more refined: Bladesinging—a forbidden art among many conservative T’alzar matriarchs for its association with old elven grace. He trained in secret, blending swordplay, illusions, and arcane performance into a style all his own.

**Velryss’s key Relationships within House T’Alzar**

Matron Severine T’alzar:  
Matron Severine T’alzar – The cold, calculating, and commanding Matron of House T’alzar. She took Velryss under her wing as a political gamble—and he became her most theatrical, volatile weapon. Their relationship is a rare mixture of unspoken respect and sharp utility. He will do anything not to disappoint her.

Velryss was not chosen to lead armies or preach dogma. He was chosen to distract, dazzle, and disarm. Severine gave him the tools to become indispensable—the house's noise, cover, and misdirection, used in places where subtlety alone might fail. Though her praise is rare, Velryss reads mountains into her silences.

Miraleh T’alzar: The one he’d Bleed for  
 Miraleth T’alzar – young and gentle-hearted. Miraleth is the only one who speaks to Velryss without fear, flattery, or formality. She sees through his mask  and accepts him anyway. He is fiercely protective of her, especially now that her father, Valandor, has gone missing. 

The only family member he's ever been truly himself with. Her presence is a reminder of what He Fights for in House T’alzar.

Valandor \- THe missing Genius:  
 Valandor T’alzar – Despite clashing personalities—Valandor, the reclusive artificer; Velryss, the flamboyant duelist—the two shared rare moments of quiet respect. They occasionally discussed theory over wine and firelight, sparring with ideas rather than blades. 

Velryss respected Valandor’s intellect and deeply valued his insights, even if the older drow's stoicism grated against his flair. Their late-night debates created a quiet kinship built on intellect and unspoken loyalty.

 Valandor’s disappearance struck Velryss more deeply than he admits. Beneath the sarcasm and silk, Velryss feels the absence like a silenced melody. His commitment to the family’s mission hides a deeper resolve: to bring Valandor home, not just for the House, but because some part of Velryss refuses to let brilliance fade without a fight. 

Lirael T’Alzar-  The mirror in Shadow:  
Lirael T'alzar – Where Velryss is flamboyance, Lirael is restraint. Where he speaks in Silk and flourishes, she carves with silence and subtlety. She isn't his formal mentor—but Velryss sees her as a measure of what he could become if he could master stillness. He deeply respects her intellect, and though he would mock her coldness publicly, he often models his deeper tactics after her unseen hand.

Vyssinia T’alzar- The Blade AT his Back:  
 Vyssinia T'alzar – Devoted to Lolth and direct action, Vyssinia and Velryss rarely agree—but they undeniably complement each other. Her brute force gives weight to his illusions, and his charm gives softness to her fearsome presence. He annoys her. She frightens him. Together, they protect the House in ways neither fully admits.
