    **Mordath "Clank" Ironshroud**


    **He is about 50 years old, just starting to mature. He is a brilliant tinkerer/inventor/builder. He is always working on something. Fidgety, with whatever is in his hands. He is hit with fits in his mind from the mind flays in his peoples past. Working on something helps clear clear his mind of it. There is always a tool that can solve any problem and he can think of it and make it. He respects well made anything and the closest to a compliment from him would be to acknowledge it. He has a hate for the surface dwellers, especially the dwarfs who he feels abandoned his people to generations of torture. He thinks they are all soft and not worthy of their easy lives. His people deserve their place and to send them to the depths for them to be forged by it, or die. He has become the clan crafter for this criminal family for their access to resources and forges for me as well as aligned goals to get to the surface where I can find a place for my people to come and take over and turn into ours. **

* What aspect of yourself are you trying to change?: ______**Learning to Trust Others**
* **Aspect to Change**: Mordath has a hard time trusting anyone, viewing relationships as transactional and driven by utility rather than genuine connection.
* **Why Change?**: As part of a strike team or adventuring group, he might come to understand the value of camaraderie and mutual trust, which could enhance his ability to work effectively in a team.
* **Obstacle**: His fear of betrayal and the harsh lessons of his past make vulnerability seem like weakness.
* __________
* What stands in the way of this change?: _____**Barriers to Mordath Trusting Others**

#### 
    **1. Cultural Conditioning**

* **Issue**: Duergar society values strength, self-reliance, and ruthless pragmatism. Trust is often seen as a weakness or liability, and alliances are forged out of necessity rather than mutual respect.
* **Impact**: Mordath’s upbringing has instilled in him a belief that trust makes one vulnerable to betrayal, manipulation, or exploitation.
* **Resolution Challenge**: Breaking free from these deeply ingrained beliefs will require him to see trust as a strength, not a flaw—a lesson he may only learn through meaningful experiences with his companions.

---


#### 
    **2. Paranoia from Betrayals**

* **Issue**: His duergar clan’s lukewarm support for his ambitious plan leaves him feeling isolated and unappreciated. He may have faced betrayal or manipulation within his clan or among surface-dwellers in the past, deepening his paranoia.
* **Impact**: These experiences reinforce his belief that no one will act in his best interest, making him hypervigilant and slow to trust anyone, even those who have shown loyalty.
* **Resolution Challenge**: To change, Mordath will need to encounter individuals whose actions consistently defy his expectations of betrayal—though this might take significant time and effort to sink in.

---


#### 
    **3. Transactional Mindset**

* **Issue**: Mordath tends to view relationships as purely transactional, where each person contributes based on utility. This makes it hard for him to form genuine bonds or recognize others’ altruistic actions as sincere.
* **Impact**: He might misinterpret loyalty or acts of kindness as hidden attempts to manipulate or extract something from him.
* **Resolution Challenge**: He must learn to value emotional connections and teamwork for their intrinsic benefits, not just as a means to an end.

---


#### 
    **4. Distrust of Surface-Dwellers and Outsiders**

* **Issue**: His hatred for surface-dwellers, especially dwarves, makes it hard for him to believe they can offer anything beyond their "softness." He views most outsiders as either inherently weak or scheming against him.
* **Impact**: This bias blinds him to the potential strengths and qualities of his companions, limiting his willingness to rely on them.
* **Resolution Challenge**: He must overcome his prejudice and judge people based on their actions rather than their heritage—a difficult task given his cultural baggage.

---


#### 
    **5. Fear of Vulnerability**

* **Issue**: Trusting others requires Mordath to lower his defenses, both emotionally and strategically. To him, vulnerability feels like an unacceptable risk, particularly in a dangerous world where he feels constantly under threat.
* **Impact**: He may double down on his self-reliance, unwilling to let others see his weaknesses or share his burdens.
* **Resolution Challenge**: Mordath will need to experience moments where sharing the load or exposing vulnerability leads to success, safety, or deeper bonds.

---


### 
    **Potential Narrative Hooks for Overcoming These Barriers**

1. **A Test of Loyalty in the Criminal Family**
    * Someone in the criminal family could betray Mordath, but another companion unexpectedly defends or rescues him. This forces him to reconsider his assumptions about loyalty and self-interest.
2. **A Crisis in the Clan**
    * His duergar clan could face a dire threat that requires him to rely on outsiders to protect their shared interests. This could challenge his prejudice and show him that trust is a strength, not a liability.
3. **A Shared Goal with His Companions**
    * Working with his group to achieve a seemingly impossible goal (e.g., uncovering a legendary forge or defeating a greater enemy) might gradually build trust, especially as they prove themselves under duress.
4. **Vulnerability During a Mind Fit**
    * If he experiences a debilitating mind fit in the middle of a critical moment, his companions could step in to protect him. Their support during his weakness might push him to see them as allies rather than tools.

---


### 
    **Roleplay Opportunities**

* Mordath might start by begrudgingly cooperating, often making sharp comments about others’ competence or reliability.
* His progression could involve subtle shifts, like hesitating before issuing a critique, showing curiosity about someone’s motives, or offering advice without being asked.
* A climactic moment could involve him placing his faith entirely in another person’s decision or ability, showcasing his growth.
*
