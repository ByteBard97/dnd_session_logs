## Description
A small, wiry goblin with bright yellow eyes and weathered hands that shake slightly when nervous. Fadda wears salt-stained studded leather and carries a trident slung across his back. His twenty years on the Black Loch have left him with countless stories and a deep, superstitious reverence for the dark waters.

## Personality
Fadda speaks in a high-pitched pidgin blend of goblin, undercommon, and his own invented words. Despite his cheerful demeanor and constant rituals, there's genuine wisdom and fear in his old eyes.
