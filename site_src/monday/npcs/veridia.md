## Personality
Due to the intricate magic of her creation, Veridia has developed a distinctive personality. She is prone to speaking in cryptic riddles and offering strangely philosophical advice at unexpected moments. Her comments often catch visitors off-guard, as they expect a simple guardian rather than a philosophical construct.

- **Distinctive Greetings**: Known for memorable (if puzzling) interactions with house members

## Construction Details
Veridia represents the pinnacle of House T'alzar's construct-crafting abilities. The combination of precious jade with dark metal creates both aesthetic beauty and functional durability. Her sentience is the result of advanced enchantment techniques that few artificers can replicate.

## Interactions with House Members
Veridia greets each house member with her unique brand of commentary, ranging from cryptic observations about their current state of mind to philosophical musings about their current activities. While sometimes puzzling, these interactions have become a cherished part of daily life at T'alzar Tower.

## Philosophical Tendencies
