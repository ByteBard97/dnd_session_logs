## Overview
**Name:** Veridia  
**Type:** Large Construct (Jade Spider Sentinel)  
**Size:** Large  
**Role:** Main entrance guardian of House T'alzar  
**Affiliation:** House Vaerixas  

**Notable Quote:** *[Cryptic chittering and clicking sounds accompanied by philosophical observations]*

## Description
Veridia is the T'alzar Jade Spider Sentinel, a construct of unique character tasked with guarding the main entryway to the T'alzar household. Created under the direct supervision of Matron Severine T'alzar, with the aid of duergar artificers and house craftsmen, Veridia's intricate jade and metal form houses a surprisingly quirky personality.

Her large form combines the elegance of carved jade with the functionality of dark metal, creating both an aesthetic masterpiece and a formidable guardian. The central jade crystal that powers her glows with varying intensity based on her perceived threat level or perhaps her 'mood.'

## Personality & Quirks
She is prone to unusual, sometimes cryptic, comments and observations, a result of the complex and perhaps slightly unstable artifice that brought her to life â€“ a 'slight screw loose,' as some might whisper. Veridia recognizes all members of House T'alzar and their allies, often greeting them with her unique brand of commentary.

## Guardian Abilities
- **House Recognition:** Identifies all T'alzar family members and authorized allies
- **Anti-Magic Field:** Her jade crystal creates magical disruption around her
- **Alarm System:** Can alert all House members within a mile of threats
- **Web Entrapment:** Launches crystallized webbing to restrain intruders

## Special Mechanics

### Deactivation Vulnerability
Veridia can be deactivated by someone with knowledge of House T'alzar's command words (like Vyssinia) using an action while touching her central jade crystal. When deactivated:
- She becomes inert for 24 hours
- All her magical effects, including the Jade Resonance field, cease
- She cannot be reactivated except by a T'alzar matron or someone with the proper activation ritual

### Crystal Behavior
- **Threat Response:** Her central jade crystal glows with varying intensity based on perceived threat level
- **Mood Indicator:** The crystal's intensity may also reflect her 'emotional' state
- **Recognition Response:** The crystal briefly alters its hue when high-ranking family members approach, a harmless aesthetic quirk

## Relationships
- **Matron Severine:** Creator and primary authority figure
- **House T'alzar Members:** Recognizes and protects all family members
- **Vyssinia:** As head of security, she knows the standard deactivation commands
- **Visitors:** Greets authorized guests with cryptic commentary

## Roleplay Notes
- **Communication:** Speaks in Drow and Undercommon with distinct clicking and chittering sounds
- **Philosophical Nature:** Prone to cryptic observations and unexpected wisdom
- **Patrol Behavior:** Makes regular rounds with distinctive mechanical sounds
- **Greeting Style:** Each house member receives unique, memorable (if puzzling) commentary

## Treasure
If Veridia is destroyed, her large central jade crystal shatters into valuable fragments potentially useful for artificing, especially valuable to someone like Clank.

## Current Status
Continues her vigilant watch over T'alzar Tower, maintaining house security while providing her distinctive brand of philosophical commentary to residents and authorized visitors. Her loyalty remains absolute despite the current crisis facing the house.
