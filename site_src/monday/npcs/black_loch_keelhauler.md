## Overview
**Type:** Monstrosity  
**Size:** Large  
**Alignment:** Unaligned  
**Habitat:** The Black Loch in the Underdark  

## Description
The Black Loch Keelhauler is a powerful aquatic monstrosity, prized by the corsairs and slavers of the Underdark as a peerless beast of burden. Its long, muscular body and powerful fins allow it to tow vessels weighing several tons for days on end without tiring. A Keelhauler's most distinct feature is the series of bony, hooked ridges that flank its spine. These are not part of its skeleton, but rather growths of dense, flexible cartilage that can be pierced with minimal harm to the creature.

## Behavior
Despite their fearsome appearance, Keelhaulers can be domesticated for use as draft animals, though they remain dangerous and unpredictable. They are curious creatures that will often surface to investigate boats and their occupants, sometimes lunging to test reactions.

## As Draft Animals
When properly trained and harnessed, Keelhaulers can tow vessels across the Black Loch for hours without tiring. They require experienced handlers like Borok the Silent who understand their temperaments and needs. The heavy leather harnesses pierce their dorsal ridges but don't seem to cause lasting harm.

## Notable Features
- Rows of dagger-like teeth
- Ability to maintain steady pace for extended periods
- Respond to specific whistles and commands from trained handlers
- Naturally curious but potentially deadly
- Prefer to circle and investigate before attacking
