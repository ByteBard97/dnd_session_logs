## Biography

The Black Mithril Screamer is the terrifying result of House Glutthraz's funding and the duergars' profane craftsmanship. A hulking suit of interlocking black metal plates that glow with faint orange fissures, this construct is built around the tormented soul of a living creature. Its right arm has been replaced with a massive, revolving drill capable of tearing through steel and stone, and its tortured screams can shatter bone. The Black Mithril fused to its chassis makes it incredibly resilient but dangerously unstable.
