## Biography

Alyxina Fire-Beard is the wife of Chief Researcher Korvun, and she is the heart of their small household within the grim Cinderfork Foundry. Her official style is 'Quartermaster of Comfort, Keeper of the Hearth-Lab,' a title she embraces with fiery optimism. She is fiercely protective of her husband, whom she affectionately calls 'my clever fool,' and will not abide others mocking him. With a tinkerer's curiosity, she can't resist fiddling with unattended gadgets, gems, or fungi. While she projects warmth, she is a sturdy clan matron who won't hesitate to defend her home with a cast-iron ladle. She is typically found in the Research Cottage (Area 2) on the foundry's sub-level.
