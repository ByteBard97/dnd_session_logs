## Biography

Chief Researcher Korvun is the brilliant mind behind the screamer torment matrices at Cinderfork Foundry. A meticulous duergar with wild, singed eyebrows and a perpetually distracted expression, he treats the creation of these abominations as pure science. He keeps detailed notes on pain thresholds and soul-binding techniques, viewing each screaming construct as a data point in his grand experiment. Despite his clinical approach to horror, he maintains a surprisingly warm relationship with his wife, Alyxina.
