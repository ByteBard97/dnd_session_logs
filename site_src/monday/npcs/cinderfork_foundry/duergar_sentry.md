## Biography

Duergar Sentries guard the critical areas of Cinderfork Foundry with unwavering discipline. They wear standardized armor marked with the foundry's seal and carry crossbows loaded with specially crafted bolts. These guards are chosen for their loyalty and lack of curiosity about the screams that echo through the facility. They rotate posts regularly to prevent complacency.
