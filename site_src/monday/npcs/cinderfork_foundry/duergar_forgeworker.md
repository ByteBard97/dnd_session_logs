## Biography

The Duergar Forgeworkers are the backbone of Cinderfork Foundry's production. These grim, soot-covered dwarves work in shifts around the clock, their faces hidden behind thick goggles and breathing masks. They rarely speak, communicating mostly through hand signals in the noisy foundry environment. Each bears burns and scars from years of dangerous work with molten metal and unstable magical energies.
