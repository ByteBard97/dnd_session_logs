## Biography

Acolyte Ghoran is the spiritual authority within the Cinderfork Foundry, a terrifying figure whose fanatical devotion to Laduguer is plain to see. He wears a tall, imposing mitre and heavy, dark robes, with thick iron chains draped over his shoulders as a sign of his holy burden. His eyes glow with a malevolent orange light as he oversees the ritualistic creation of Screamers, viewing each tormented shriek as a hymn to his god. He believes that suffering is a holy state and that true power is forged only through pain and agony.
