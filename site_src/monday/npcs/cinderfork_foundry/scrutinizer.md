## Biography

The Scrutinizer is a specialized construct designed to monitor and evaluate screamer production quality. This spider-like automaton skitters through the foundry on eight articulated legs, its cluster of crystal eyes recording every detail. It communicates through a series of clicks and whirs that the foundry workers have learned to interpret. Unlike the screamers, the Scrutinizer shows no signs of consciousness, operating purely on programmed directives.
