## Biography

Foundry Master Borok oversees the day-to-day operations of the screamer production line. A veteran duergar with arms like tree trunks and a voice that cuts through the foundry's din, he ensures quotas are met through a combination of harsh discipline and grudging respect for skilled work. His face is a map of old burns, and he's missing two fingers on his left hand from an early accident he refuses to discuss.
