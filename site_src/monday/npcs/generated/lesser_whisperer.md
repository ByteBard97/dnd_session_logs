## Traits

### Amphibious
The Lesser Whisperer can breathe air and water.

### Elusive Nature
The Lesser Whisperer can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it (Medium). While squeezing through a space, it moves at half speed.

### Hypnotic Eyes
The Lesser Whisperer has 1d4 eyes on stalks that can cast dim light in a 15-foot radius. As a bonus action, The Lesser Whisperer can do one of the following:

• Activate or deactivate the glow of any number of its eyes.
• Disguise one eye stalk to appear as a small humanoid figure (illusion, Investigation DC 15 to discern).
• Emit a low hum that can be heard within 150 ft. Creatures who hear it must succeed on a DC 15 WIS save or feel compelled to move toward the source.

## Actions

### Multiattack
The Lesser Whisperer makes two tentacle attacks.

### Tentacle
Melee: +7 to hit, one target. *Hit:* 1d8+4 bludgeoning.

Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained. The Lesser Whisperer has 4 tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

### Bite
Melee: +7 to hit, one creature that is grappled by The Lesser Whisperer. *Hit:* 2d8+4 piercing.

Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.

### Mesmerizing Whisper (Recharge 5-6)
The Lesser Whisperer targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 WIS save or be magically charmed by The Lesser Whisperer for 1 minute. The charmed target is incapacitated and has a speed of 0. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target takes damage, it immediately gets another saving throw with advantage.

### Ink Cloud (1/Day)
While underwater, The Lesser Whisperer expels a cloud of dark ink in a 20-foot radius. The cloud spreads around corners, and that area is heavily obscured to creatures other than The Lesser Whisperer. Each creature other than The Lesser Whisperer that starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears after 1 minute.
