## Traits

### Fey Ancestry
Lirael has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put her to sleep.

### Sunlight Sensitivity
While in sunlight, Lirael has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Kael, the Raven Familiar
Lirael has a permanent raven familiar named Kael, which acts on her turn. She can communicate with it telepathically within 100 feet and use it to deliver touch spells.

### Spellcasting
Lirael is a 9th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). She has the following bard spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): Mage Hand, Minor Illusion, Vicious Mockery
1st level (4 slots): Charm Person, Dissonant Whispers, Healing Word, Silvery Barbs
2nd level (3 slots): Heat Metal, Hold Person, Suggestion
3rd level (3 slots): Counterspell, Fireball, Hypnotic Pattern
4th level (3 slots): Confusion, Greater Invisibility
5th level (1 slot): Legend Lore

### Instrument of the Bards (Runecarved Flute)
Lirael's ebony flute can be used as a spellcasting focus. Creatures have disadvantage on saves vs. her charm spells. Once per day, she can use it to cast Fly, Invisibility, Levitate, Protection from Evil and Good, Darkness, Faerie Fire, Web, and Maddening Darkness.

### Bardic Inspiration (5/Short Rest)
As a bonus action, Lirael can inspire an ally within 60 feet. The ally gains a d8 Bardic Inspiration die to add to one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.

### Jack of All Trades
Lirael adds half her proficiency bonus (+2) to any ability check that doesn't already include her proficiency bonus.

### Song of Rest (d8)
During a short rest, Lirael can perform a song that helps allies recover. Any ally who hears the song regains an extra 1d8 hit points if they spend Hit Dice during the rest.

### Additional Magical Secrets
Lirael chose two spells from other classes: Counterspell and Fireball.

### Cutting Words
When a creature Lirael can see within 60 feet makes an attack roll, ability check, or damage roll, she can use her reaction to spend a Bardic Inspiration die and reduce the roll by the number rolled.
