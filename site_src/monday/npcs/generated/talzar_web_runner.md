## Biography

Valandor's personal creation, a spider-like construct that moves with unsettling speed. It serves as his mobile workbench, bodyguard, and assistant. Its chassis is a mix of darkwood and reinforced bronze, with multiple articulated limbs that can manipulate tools or stabilize its body like a tripod. It is fiercely loyal and acts with cold, calculated efficiency to protect its master.
