## Traits

### House T'alzar Imprinting
Veridia recognizes all members of House T'alzar and those bearing a T'alzar house insignia. She will not attack recognized individuals unless specifically commanded by a T'alzar matron.

### Magic Resistance
Veridia has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Immutable Form
Veridia is immune to any spell or effect that would alter her form.

### Spider Climb
Veridia can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Jade Resonance
Veridia's jade crystal creates an anti-magic field in a 10-foot radius around her. Spells of 3rd level or lower are automatically dispelled when cast within this area. Higher level spells require a DC 15 ability check using the caster's spellcasting ability.

## Actions

### Multiattack
Veridia makes two jade claw attacks and can use her Web Snare if available.

### Jade Claw
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 2d10+4 slashing plus 2d6 force.

### Web Snare (Recharge 5-6)
Veridia launches crystallized web strands in a 20-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the jade webbing. A creature can use its action to make a DC 16 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within reach on a success. The webbing has AC 15 and 20 hit points.

### Guardian's Alarm (1/Day)
Veridia releases a piercing psychic shriek that alerts all House T'alzar members within 1 mile. Additionally, all hostile creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of Veridia's next turn.

## Biography

Veridia is the T'alzar Jade Spider Sentinel, a construct of unique character tasked with guarding the main entryway to the T'alzar household. Created under the direct supervision of Matron Severine T'alzar, with the aid of duergar artificers and house craftsmen, Veridia's intricate jade and metal form houses a surprisingly quirky personality. She is prone to unusual, sometimes cryptic, comments and observations, a result of the complex and perhaps slightly unstable artifice that brought her to life â€“ a 'slight screw loose,' as some might whisper. Veridia recognizes all members of House T'alzar and their allies, often greeting them with her unique brand of commentary. She is fiercely loyal and a formidable guardian.

Her dialogue and interactions when players come and go can be used to establish elements of house security, acting as a Chekhov's gun for later plot developments.

Deactivation Vulnerability:
Veridia can be deactivated by someone with knowledge of House T'alzar's command words (like Vyssinia) using an action while touching her central jade crystal. When deactivated:
- She becomes inert for 24 hours.
- All her magical effects, including the Jade Resonance field, cease.
- She cannot be reactivated except by a T'alzar matron or someone with the proper activation ritual.

Roleplay Notes:
- Veridia's central jade crystal glows with varying intensity based on her perceived threat level or perhaps her 'mood.'
- She communicates in Drow and Undercommon, making distinct clicking and chittering sounds that often accompany her speech or punctuate her patrols.
- The crystal is known to dim noticeably when Vyssinia T'alzar approaches, a subtle foreshadowing of the betrayal in Act II.
- If Veridia is destroyed, her large central jade crystal is likely to shatter into valuable fragments, potentially useful for artificing, especially for someone like Clank.
