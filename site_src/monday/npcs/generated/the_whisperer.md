## Traits

### Amphibious
The Whisperer can breathe air and water.

### Coleoideaic
The Whisperer can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature two sizes smaller than it (large). While squeezing through a space, the whisperer can move at normal speed. Other movement penalties apply.

### Dead Ringer
The Whisperer has 1d6 eyes. Each sits on a vaguely humanoid-shaped stalk and is capable of casting bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. While little more than primitive light receptors, these eyes are equipped with quite advanced psionic powers of detection and subterfuge. As a bonus action, The Whisperer can do one of the following:

• Activate or deactivate the glow of any number of its eyes.
• Enshroud one of its eye stalks in a magical disguise functionally equivalent to the alter self spell (requiring no components), making it appear as any medium-sized humanoid that The Whisperer can see within range or with which it is familiar.
• Emit a low-frequency thrum from the socket of any eyestalk. This thrum can be heard in a radius of 300 ft. both above and below water. Creatures who hear the thrum must succeed on a DC 17 CHA save or are compelled to identify the source of the sound.

### Freedom of Movement
The Whisperer ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can't reduce its speed or cause it to be restrained. It can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled.

## Actions

### Tentacle
Melee: +10 to hit, one target. *Hit:* 2d6+5 bludgeoning.

Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 18). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained. The Whisperer has 1d6+2 tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

### Bite
Melee: +10 to hit, one creature that is grappled by The Whisperer. *Hit:* 4d8+5 piercing.

Hit: 23 (4d8 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside The Whisperer, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of The Whisperer's turns.

### Fling
One Medium or smaller object held or creature grappled by The Whisperer is thrown up to 40 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.

### Enthrall
The Whisperer targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 WIS save or be magically charmed by The Whisperer until The Whisperer dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from the target. The charmed target is under The Whisperer's control and can't take reactions, and The Whisperer and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance. Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target gains awareness of its charmed condition and can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from The Whisperer.

Upon the effect ending, the creature is cursed, and must make a DC 20 History check to recall any of the actions it took while charmed, as well as any communications it had with The Whisperer, taking 2d6 psychic damage on a fail. This effect may be removed by a remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spell.
