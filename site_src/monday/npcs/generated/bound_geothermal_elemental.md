## Traits

### Bound to the Foundry
The elemental is magically bound to the foundry's power systems by arcane chains. While bound, it cannot move more than 30 feet from the center of Area 8 (Water Wheel), and it takes 1d6 psychic damage at the start of each turn. If the binding is broken, it becomes free to act but triggers a foundry-wide alarm.

### Earth Glide
The elemental can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While doing so, the elemental doesn't disturb the material it moves through.

### Fire Form
The elemental can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. A creature that touches the elemental or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage.

### Illumination
The elemental sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light in an additional 30 feet.

### Power Source
While bound, the elemental powers the entire foundry. If it dies or escapes, all machinery stops, lights fail, and the foundry loses power for 24 hours.

## Actions

### Multiattack
The elemental makes two slam attacks.

### Slam
Melee: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 2d8+5 bludgeoning plus 1d6 fire.

On a hit, if the target is a creature or a flammable object, it ignites. Until someone takes an action to douse the fire, the creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

### Molten Rock Barrage (Recharge 5-6)
The elemental hurls chunks of molten rock in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Bonus Actions

### Geothermal Vent
The elemental causes a 10-foot radius area within 60 feet to erupt with superheated steam and debris. Creatures in the area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) fire damage and be blinded until the end of their next turn.

## Reactions

### Binding Backlash
When the elemental takes damage while bound, it can use its reaction to send a surge of energy through the foundry's power systems. All creatures within 30 feet of any powered machinery must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 9 (2d8) lightning damage.

## Biography

This tortured fusion of earth and fire elementals has been bound to power the Cinderfork Foundry through arcane chains and constant agony. The duergar's cruel magic forces it to channel its elemental essence through the foundry's machinery, creating the immense heat and power needed for their dark works. Its rocky form writhes with veins of molten stone, and its eyes burn with the fury of a caged volcano. If freed, it seeks immediate vengeance against its captors before attempting to return to its home plane.
