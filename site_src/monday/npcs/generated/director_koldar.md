1/day each: invisibility (self only), suggestion

### Cunning Negotiator
Koldar has advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks when negotiating contracts or business deals.

### Sunlight Sensitivity

## Actions

### Poisoned Dagger
Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1d4+2 piercing.

A creature hit by this attack must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Reactions

### Redirect Blame
When Koldar is targeted by an attack while a creature is within 5 feet of him, he can use his reaction to force the attacker to make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature nearest to Koldar instead. This ability cannot be used again until he finishes a short or long rest.

## Biography

He manages the business with an iron fist, using his sharp mind and political acumen to navigate the treacherous relationships with outsiders like House Glutthraz.
