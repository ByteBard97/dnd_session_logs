## Traits

### Distress Spores
When Uulk takes damage, all other myconids within 240 feet of him can sense his distress.

### Sun Sickness
While in sunlight, Uulk has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. Uulk dies if he spends more than 1 hour in direct sunlight.

### Spore Network
Uulk can communicate telepathically with any myconid within 1 mile through spore connections. This network can relay simple messages across vast distances through connected fungi.

### Colony Leader
Uulk can command up to 12 myconid adults and any number of myconid sprouts within his spore network. Commanded myconids gain advantage on attack rolls while within 30 feet of Uulk.

## Actions

### Multiattack
Uulk makes two fist attacks or uses his spore abilities twice.

### Fist
Melee: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1d8+3 bludgeoning plus 2d6 poison.

On a hit, the target takes an additional 7 (2d6) poison damage.

### Pacifying Spores (3/Day)
Uulk ejects spores at one creature he can see within 15 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Rapport Spores (1/Day)
Uulk releases spores that create a telepathic bond with creatures in a 30-foot radius for 1 hour. Affected creatures can communicate telepathically with each other while within 30 feet. Uulk can choose which creatures are affected.

### Animating Spores (1/Day)
Uulk targets a humanoid corpse within 5 feet. The corpse becomes a spore servant under Uulk's control (use zombie statistics but with plant type instead of undead). The spore servant remains animated for 24 hours.

### Hallucination Spores (1/Day)
Uulk ejects spores in a 15-foot radius. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature sees and hears things that aren't there for 1 minute, becoming effectively blinded and deafened to real threats and creatures. Affected creatures can repeat the save at the end of each turn.

## Bonus Actions

### Spore Communication
Uulk can send telepathic messages to any myconid within his spore network, or communicate with Haribo specifically regardless of distance while both are alive.

## Reactions

### Protective Spores
When a myconid ally within 30 feet takes damage, Uulk can release protective spores that reduce the damage by 1d6.

## Biography

Uulk is the wise and ancient leader of the Musca myconid colony, allied with House T'alzar through a mutual understanding of survival and growth. As an elder myconid, he commands respect through both his age and his mastery of spore-based abilities. Uulk values the collective effort above individual achievement and sees the partnership with House T'alzar as beneficial for expanding myconid influence. He serves as Haribo the Spreader's mentor and contact, providing guidance and support for the surface mission while maintaining the deeper colony's interests.
