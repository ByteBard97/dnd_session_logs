**Spell Save DC:** 20, **Spell Attack Bonus:** +12

## Actions

### Multiattack
Zephyra can cast a spell and make one weapon attack, or make two weapon attacks, or cast two spells of 3rd level or lower.

### Scourge of Fangs
Melee: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 2d6+4 slashing plus 3d6 necrotic.

On a hit, target must succeed on a DC 20 CON save or be poisoned for 1 minute.

### Hand Crossbow
Ranged: +10 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1d6+4 piercing plus 4d6 poison.

On a hit, target must succeed on a DC 18 CON save for half poison damage.

### Crushing Authority (Recharge 5-6)
Zephyra unleashes her overwhelming presence in a 30-foot radius. All creatures of her choice in the area must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they take 21 (6d6) psychic damage and are stunned until the end of their next turn. On a success, they take half damage and are not stunned.

### Glutthraz's Wealth (1/Day)
Zephyra channels her house's vast resources into a devastating display. She creates a 20-foot radius area of difficult terrain centered on a point within 60 feet. The area fills with summoned treasure, weapons, and constructs that attack indiscriminately. Creatures starting their turn in the area take 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage (DC 20 Dex save for half). The effect lasts for 1 minute.

## Bonus Actions

## Reactions

### Counterspell
When a creature casts a spell within 60 feet, Zephyra can cast counterspell using a spell slot.

### Shield
When hit by an attack or targeted by magic missile, Zephyra can cast shield to gain +5 AC until the start of her next turn.

## Biography

Matron Mother Zephyra Glutthraz is the ruthless head of House Glutthraz, the resource monopolist house that has systematically crushed House T'alzar's economic power. Where Severine T'alzar is a subtle chess master, Zephyra is overwhelming force personified - she believes that sufficient resources and power can solve any problem. Her house controls critical supply lines, mining operations, and trade routes throughout the Underdark. She views House T'alzar's resistance as an irritating inefficiency to be eliminated. Zephyra's power comes not just from her personal magical abilities, but from her house's vast accumulated wealth and the armies it can buy. She sees the surface world as another resource to be claimed and exploited, making the mission to Phandalin a direct threat to her expanding dominion.
