## Biography

Borok is a massive Orog, even larger than most of his kind, with broad, powerful shoulders and skin the color of wet slate. His face is a mask of scars, with one milky-white eye and one that is a sharp, intelligent black. He is bald, and a series of interlocking, geometric tattoos cover his scalp and the left side of his face, marking him as a member of the unaffiliated Black-Tusk Corsairs. He wears piecemeal armor of chitin and blackened steel and carries a heavy, serrated greataxe strapped to his back. Borok is taciturn to a fault, communicating in grunts and short, guttural commands to his crew. He is a pragmatic professional; the mission and his payment are all that matter.
