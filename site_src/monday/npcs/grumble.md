## Character Overview
**Name:** Grumble  
**Type:** Intelligent Flesh Golem  
**Affiliation:** House Talzar  
**Role:** Heavy lifting specialist and drilling machine operator  
**Age:** 47 years conscious  

## Description
Grumble is a massive, stitched-together flesh golem constructed from multiple drow corpses and possibly some duergar parts. Despite his imposing physical presence, he possesses the combined memories and knowledge of several brilliant drow minds, making him far more intelligent than his role suggests.

## Personality
Grumble embodies existential pessimism with intellectual superiority. He speaks in a monotone, deadpan manner and constantly complains about being relegated to manual labor despite his vast accumulated knowledge. He has poor fine motor control due to his mismatched body parts, preventing him from performing the delicate work his brilliant minds are capable of understanding.

## Abilities & Limitations
**Can do:**
- Heavy lifting and moving large objects
- Operating drilling machines and simple machinery  
- Basic tool use and gross motor tasks
- Provide surprisingly insightful (if gloomy) advice

**Cannot do:**
- Cast spells
- Perform delicate artifice work
- Precise manufacturing processes
- Fine motor control tasks

## Notable Quotes
*"Here I am, brain the size of a small library, and they want me to carry things. Call that job satisfaction? 'Cause I don't."*

*"Life. Don't talk to me about life. I've been dead, then undead, then... whatever this is. And somehow it just keeps getting worse."*

*"I could calculate the trajectory needed to collapse this entire foundry, but will anyone ask? No. They'll just say 'Grumble, lift that' or 'Grumble, drill here.' Marvelous."*

## Role in House Talzar
Grumble serves as the house's go-to specialist for heavy-duty tasks and machinery operation. Despite his constant complaints, he remains functionally loyal to the house and occasionally provides valuable counsel when his vast accumulated knowledge is actually consulted.
