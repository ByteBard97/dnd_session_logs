He serves as first mate aboard various vessels, combining practical seamanship with his mystical devotion to the loch itself, which he worships as a living deity. His pidgin speech and constant rituals might seem eccentric, but his supernatural ability to navigate the treacherous waters and predict the loch's moods makes him invaluable to any crew. Despite his superstitious nature, he possesses genuine magical power drawn from his faith in the Deep Black, as he calls his deity."
