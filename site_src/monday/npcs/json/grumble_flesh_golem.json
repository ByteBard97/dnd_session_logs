On each of his turns while berserk, Grumble attacks the nearest creature he can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, Grumble attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than himself.

He is capable of complex communication, creative problem-solving (usually to point out the futility of the problem or the intellectual inferiority of the plan), and expressing his existential despair with cutting wit and a surprisingly vast vocabulary."

      "desc": "Grumble frequently makes dour, sarcastic, and highly articulate observations about the utter pointlessness of most situations. These comments, delivered in his characteristic monotone, can sometimes, quite by accident from his perspective, provide an uncomfortably astute insight into problems, giving allies advantage on one Intelligence-based skill check per day when Grumble deigns to share his 'helpful' perspective on impending doom or wasted effort. This is particularly true for matters of Arcana, History, or Investigation, fields in which his intellect far outstrips his assigned duties."

Choose one enemy within 30 feet that can hear him. That creature must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be momentarily distracted by the sheer accuracy of his pessimism, giving the next attack against it advantage."

The sheer unexpectedness of this advice somehow helps them. The ally gains +2 AC against that attack."

  "bio": "Grumble is an intelligent flesh golem assembled by Matron Severine to serve House T'alzar. He is dour, sarcastic, and prone to dry, pessimistic commentary (think Marvin the Paranoid Android). He obeys the party leader's commands, but rarely cheerfully. His loyalty is functional, not emotional, and he often complains about the indignities of his existence."
