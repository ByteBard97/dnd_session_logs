The interrupted ceremony has left the construct in a state of chaotic fury, unable to distinguish between friend and foe. Orange energy crackles along the fissures in its black metal plating, and its movements are erratic and unpredictable.\n\nThe tortured soul bound within screams not just in anguish, but in confusion - it attacks whatever is nearest, regardless of allegiance. The Black Mithril's raw power makes it incredibly dangerous, but its instability means even its creators cannot control it.\n\nüé≠ ROLEPLAY TIPS:\n- Describe the orange fissures flaring before each chaos roll\n- The construct groans and sparks unpredictably\n- Its movements are jerky and unnatural\n- Even the duergar are terrified of their creation\n- Perfect foreshadowing for Act II house assault"
