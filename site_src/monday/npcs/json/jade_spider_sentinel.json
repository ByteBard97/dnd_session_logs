  "bio": "Veridia is the T'alzar Jade Spider Sentinel, a construct of unique character tasked with guarding the main entryway to the T'alzar household. Created under the direct supervision of Matron Severine T'alzar, with the aid of duergar artificers and house craftsmen, Veridia's intricate jade and metal form houses a surprisingly quirky personality. She is prone to unusual, sometimes cryptic, comments and observations, a result of the complex and perhaps slightly unstable artifice that brought her to life â€“ a 'slight screw loose,' as some might whisper. Veridia recognizes all members of House T'alzar and their allies, often greeting them with her unique brand of commentary. She is fiercely loyal and a formidable guardian.\n\nHer dialogue and interactions when players come and go can be used to establish elements of house security, acting as a Chekhov's gun for later plot developments.\n\nDeactivation Vulnerability:\nVeridia can be deactivated by someone with knowledge of House T'alzar's command words (like Vyssinia) using an action while touching her central jade crystal. When deactivated:\n- She becomes inert for 24 hours.\n- All her magical effects, including the Jade Resonance field, cease.\n- She cannot be reactivated except by a T'alzar matron or someone with the proper activation ritual.\n\nRoleplay Notes:\n- Veridia's central jade crystal glows with varying intensity based on her perceived threat level or perhaps her 'mood.'\n- She communicates in Drow and Undercommon, making distinct clicking and chittering sounds that often accompany her speech or punctuate her patrols.\n- The crystal is known to dim noticeably when Vyssinia T'alzar approaches, a subtle foreshadowing of the betrayal in Act II.\n- If Veridia is destroyed, her large central jade crystal is likely to shatter into valuable fragments, potentially useful for artificing, especially for someone like Clank."
