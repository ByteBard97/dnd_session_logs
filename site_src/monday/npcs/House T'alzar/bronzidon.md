### Actions

> **Multiattack.** Bronzidon makes two Bite attacks, or one Bite and one Seize attack.
> 
> **Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (3d8 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn as tiny sparks dance across the wound. Bronzidon can choose to deal bludgeoning damage instead of piercing.
> 
> **Seize.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16). Until the grapple ends, Bronzidon can't make another Seize attack.
> 
> **Arc-Slag Fumes (Recharge 5-6).** Bronzidon expels a cloud of shimmering, super-heated vapor in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save a creature is incapacitated and its speed becomes 0 as coughing fits set in. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The effect is non-lethal and leaves a sooty metallic scent.
