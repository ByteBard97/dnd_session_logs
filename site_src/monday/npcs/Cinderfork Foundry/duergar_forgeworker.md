## Biography

These are the common laborers of the Cinderfork Foundry. They are strong and resilient from a lifetime of toil in the extreme heat, but lack the formal military training or advanced equipment of Duergar guards. They fight with the heavy hammers they use for their daily work, making them a dangerous obstacle in numbers.
