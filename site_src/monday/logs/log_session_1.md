# Session 1

### **Session 1 Outline: The Price of Ambition**

 **Overall Goal:** Introduce the players to their characters, the precarious state of House T'alzar, the central family conflict, and the inciting incident for the campaign.

---

#### **Part 1: Introduction \- A House on the Brink**

* **DM Read-Aloud: ** Begin the session by reading the full introduction from the ** 1\_campaign\_introduction.md** document.  
  * **Key Points to Establish:**  
    * **House T'alzar:** A noble house of renowned drow artificers.  
    * **House Glutthras:** The rival house waging a devastating economic war via their control of "the Obsidian Vault."  
    * **The Hope: ** The mission of the brilliant artificer, ** Valandor T'alzar**, who is away at Cinderfork Foundry researching a legendary alloy that could save the house.  
* **Player Introductions:** Each player introduces their character, their specific role within House T'alzar, and how they are personally affected by the house's decline.

#### **Part 2: The Fighting Pits \- A Lesson in Philosophy**

* **The Summons:** The party is summoned to the fighting pits by **Lady Vyssinia T'alzar** for a "practice session." Her sister, the spymaster **Lirael T'alzar**, is also present as an observer.  
* **The Reveal:** Following the read-aloud from **2\_the\_battle.md**, Vyssinia bypasses a simple sparring match and orders the release of a full-fledged **Drider**.  
* **Combat Encounter:** The party fights the Drider.  
  * **Dynamic Commentary:** Throughout the fight, the DM should use the scripted commentary from the battle document to highlight the sisters' conflicting views.  
    * **Vyssinia** shouts encouragement for glorious, faith-driven violence.  
    * **Lirael** offers cool, tactical advice, growing frustrated with her sister's recklessness.  
* **Victory & Reward:** The party defeats the Drider.  
  * **The Killing Blow:** Per your notes, **Bentham** lands the final hit.  
  * **Vyssinia's Prize:** Triumphant, Vyssinia rewards Bentham's prowess by offering a choice of one magic item from her personal collection (e.g., *Amulet of Misty Step*, *Gloves of the Growling Underdog*, etc.).  
* **The Aftermath \- A Debate of Ideals:** The two sisters descend to the arena floor and argue over the "lesson."  
  * Vyssinia defends the act as a necessary and glorious sacrifice to Lolth.  
  * Lirael condemns it as a foolish waste of a valuable intelligence asset (revealing the Drider was a captured spy).  
  * This scene firmly establishes the deep ideological rift within the house leadership and gives the players their first chance to see who their philosophies might align with.

#### **Part 3: Anxious Days \- The Weight of Waiting**

* **Transition:** A few days pass. The mood in T'alzar Tower grows heavy, as Valandor is now officially overdue.  
* **Downtime Opportunities (from 2.5\_anxious\_days.md):** Run one or two short, optional scenes to build atmosphere and allow for character interaction.  
  * A visit to **Clank's workshop** reveals the tangible effects of the Glutthraz blockade on their supplies.  
  * Passing by the house shrine, the party can witness **Vyssinia's fervent zealotry** , foreshadowing her dangerous fanaticism.  
  * A quiet conversation with **Lirael** in the library can build trust and provide tactical insight into their enemies.

#### **Part 4: The Mission \- The Matron's Gambit**

* **The Briefing: ** The party is summoned to the grand ballroom, now converted into a war room. ** Matron Severine T'alzar ** and the morose flesh golem ** Grumble** are waiting.  
* **The Dire News:** Matron Severine, with barely controlled emotion, informs the party that Valandor is officially missing.  
* **The Objectives: ** This is no longer a matter of waiting; it is a ** rescue mission**.  
  1. **Primary:** Infiltrate Cinderfork Foundry and bring Valandor home.  
  2. **Secondary:** Secure all of his research on Black Mithril.  
  3. **Tertiary:** Find proof of Glutthraz's involvement and, if Valandor is lost, send an unmistakable message of retribution.  
* **The Three Plans:** The Matron lays out three potential avenues of approach for the party to choose from:  
  1. **The Artificer (Force):** Use a massive siege drill operated by Grumble.  
  2. **The Ghost (Stealth):** An underwater infiltration using potions and magic.  
  3. **The Serpent (Deception):** A social infiltration using disguises.

 **End of Session:**

The session concludes with the party being presented with these three plans. The weight of their brother's life and the fate of their entire house rests on the choice they make next.
