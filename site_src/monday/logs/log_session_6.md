<link rel="stylesheet" href="../drow_theme.css">

## Session Overview
**Campaign:** Monday Drow Campaign  
**Date:** Session 6  
**Location:** Cinderfork Foundry - Ground Floor  

---

## Session Summary

The party continues their infiltration of Cinderfork Foundry, facing the challenge of bypassing a massive turbine and systematically eliminating threats to secure their path to Valandor.

### Objectives
- Find a way past the turbine
- Locate Valandor
- Acquire the remaining Rods of Opening

---

## Bypassing the Turbine

The party began the session facing the massive, high-speed turbine blocking their path.

### Initial Attempts
- **Zyntra** attempted to cast *Slow* on the turbine to make it crossable
- While the spell worked, **Haribo** attempted to cross and nearly failed his acrobatics check, narrowly avoiding being shredded (saved by being inside Clank's Bag of Holding)
- The party abandoned the magic-based plan and opted to use the control levers they had learned about previously

### Successful Crossing
- The plan: Party crosses while turbine is slowed by one lever, then **Bentham** (who has *Misty Step*) resets the lever and crosses before it returns to full speed
- This plan was successful - the party crossed the now-slower blades and Bentham reset the controls without triggering a full foundry-wide alarm

## Reaching the Ground Floor & Scouting the Forge

### Ground Floor Discovery
- The party ascended a stairwell to the foundry's ground floor
- Discovered a large **mess hall** where six off-duty Duergar workers were drinking and playing cards

### The Forge Horror
- Stairs continued up, so they scouted the next level and witnessed the main forge
- Horrific scene: A Duergar victim was being strapped into a frame to be turned into a "Screamer" by:
  - **Acolyte Goran** (priest)
  - A **Master Smith**
- Recognizing they were unprepared for the powerful enemies on the forge level, the party made a tactical decision to retreat to the mess hall floor and eliminate the lesser threats first

---

## Setting the Trap & The Stairwell Ambush

### The Grenade Trap
- New plan: Set a multi-point explosive trap in the stairwell using remaining grenades to kill anyone coming down from the forge
- While setting the trap, they heard two Duergar workers begin to descend the stairs

### Deception and Elimination
- **Bentham**, still disguised as the researcher's wife Alexina, successfully deceived the guards
- Berating them, he lured them back up the stairs, away from the party
- **Malaggar** and **Bentham** then ambushed the two distracted guards, killing them silently in the stairwell
- Bodies were disposed of
- With the threat neutralized, the party finished arming their grenade trap in the stairwell

---

## The Mess Hall Annihilation

### Coordinated Assault Preparation
The party prepared a devastating coordinated assault on the mess hall:

1. **Rav'ithar** cast *Silence* over the main room to contain the noise of battle
2. **Haribo** cast *Spike Growth* to block and disable the main elevator, trapping a Duergar who was in an adjacent latrine

### The Surprise Round
The party initiated with devastating effect:
- **Zyntra** killed a worker with *Green-Flame Blade*
- **Clank** and **Rav'ithar** provided ranged support
- **Malaggar**, using his Gloomstalker abilities, killed two workers with his rapier
- **Bentham**, using his Assassin's auto-crit feature, instantly killed a tougher Duergar guard in a side room

### Systematic Elimination
Combat ensued as the party worked systematically to eliminate the remaining Duergar guards and workers:
- **Haribo** engaged a guard at the front portcullis, eventually crushing him by dropping the gate on him
- The remaining guards, including:
  - One with a fire-spray lance
  - A "Mind Master"
- Were cornered and killed by the party's combined efforts
- The party successfully cleared the entire floor of all hostile forces

---

## Session End: The Trap is Sprung

### Aftermath
- With the combat over, the party began looting the bodies
- Preparing to use their potions of "angelic slumber" to gain the benefits of a long rest in a matter of minutes

### Cliffhanger
Just as they began to settle, they heard **three loud, distinct explosions** from the stairwell above, confirming their trap had been triggered by an unknown entity descending from the forge level.

**The session ended on this dramatic cliffhanger.**
