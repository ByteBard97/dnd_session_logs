# Session 9 Quest Log:

### August 11, 2025

* **The Office Standoff**
    * The party burst into Director Koldar's office, where he was meeting with the drow spy, Liaison Malexa. Ravithar noticed the room was magically silenced from outside noise.
    * Director Koldar immediately hit an alarm bell.
    * Ravithar attempted to de-escalate with dialogue, but Malexa identified Malagar by name and house, exposing the party's identity.

* **Combat Begins**
    * **Malagar's Turn:** Reacting to being identified, Malagar used Dread Ambusher to attack Malexa, landing a critical hit despite her magical shield bracers. He then used Hunter's Mark, but his subsequent attacks were deflected by her shield.
    * **Haribo's Turn:** Peeking through the keyhole, Haribo saw reinforcements mustering, including the Black Mithril Screamer and giant-sized duergar. He summoned his otyugh ally, "Shih Tzu," into the office, then cast *Wall of Thorns* outside the door, damaging and trapping the enemies in the forge. He then shut the door.
    * **Ravithar's Turn:** Seeing the situation had escalated, Ravithar cast *Hold Person* on Director Koldar, who failed his saving throw and was paralyzed. Ravithar later picked up Koldar's dropped *Rod of Torment*.
    * **Clank's Turn:** Clank punched at the paralyzed Director Koldar with his Thunder Gauntlet but missed. He then activated his Defensive Field for temporary hit points.
    * **Bentham's Turn:** Initially making a peaceful gesture by placing his daggers on Koldar's desk, Bentham later shot the Director with his crossbow after combat was fully engaged.
    * **Zintra's Turn:** Zintra climbed onto the ceiling, but her attack against Koldar missed.

* **The Door is Breached**
    * The Black Mithril Screamer outside used its drill arm to smash a hole through the office door.
    * The Acolyte outside cast a *Fear* spell in a cone through the doorway, causing Malagar, Clank, Haribo, and Shih Tzu to become frightened, drop their weapons, and flee into the adjacent bedroom.
    * The Screamer then completely destroyed the door and entered the office. It unleashed a Resonant Scream, dealing thunder damage to everyone nearby. The unconscious Malexa failed two death saving throws from this damage.

* **The Tide Turns**
    * **Ravithar's Turn:** Having become invisible, Ravithar snuck out of the office and shot the Acolyte with his pistol, dealing a critical hit for 30 damage and killing him instantly. The death of the Acolyte ended the *Fear* effect.
    * **Clank's Turn:** Clank picked up the dropped *Rod of Torment* and used its "Pain Echo" ability on the Screamer. The psychic attack caused the construct to malfunction.
    * **Screamer's Malfunction:** The Screamer went berserk, unleashing a blast of lightning that killed Haribo's myconid sprout but also heavily damaged itself and the surrounding duergar.
    * **Malagar's Turn:** With the Screamer damaged and confused, Malagar attacked relentlessly, destroying the construct. The helmet fell off, revealing the corpse of the duergar who had been fused inside.

* **Victory and Aftermath**
    * **Grumble's Arrival:** With the main threats eliminated, the remaining duergar tried to flee. Zintra used a sending stone to call Grumble, who arrived on the lift and dispatched the last of the enemies, including the Master Smith.
    * **Final Casualty:** Liaison Malexa, having failed her earlier death saves, died on the office floor before she could be stabilized.
    * **Loot & Next Steps:** The party secured the area and cleared it of enemies. They discussed their plan to thoroughly loot the Director's office and bedroom (which contains a safe and a locked chest) and then decide whether to sabotage and destroy the foundry to cover their tracks.
