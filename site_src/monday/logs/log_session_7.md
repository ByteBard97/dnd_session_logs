# **Session 7 Quest Log: The Depths of the Foundry**

**Starting Point:** The T'alzar Strike Team has just cleared the mess hall (Area 10\) on the middle floor of the Cinderfork Foundry. Moments ago, the grenade traps they set in the main stairwell above detonated with three massive explosions.

### **1\. The Aftermath and Blocked Passage**

* Immediately following the explosions, the party takes a short rest, using potions to recover. Haribo and Rav'ithar consume Potions of Angelic Reprieve, gaining the benefits of a full long rest.  
* A powerful tremor shakes the foundry, separate from the initial blasts. Zintra's keen perception identifies it as a significant structural impact.  
* The party sends a familiar up the main stairwell to investigate. It discovers that the grenade trap was overwhelmingly effective: the explosions caused the stairwell to collapse entirely, blocking the path to the upper levels with a massive pile of rock and debris. The primary route upwards is now impassable.

### **2\. Securing the Middle Floor**

* With the way up blocked, the team decides to systematically clear and explore the current (middle) floor.  
* **Investigating the Prison Door:** The party investigates the heavy adamantine door believed to lead to Valandor's cell. They find it covered in glowing, pulsating runes and determine it is magically reinforced and will be difficult to breach by conventional means.  
* **Guards' Quarters (Area 8):** Zintra begins the painstaking process of lockpicking the eight footlockers belonging to the duergar guards.  
* **Private Dining Room (Area 11):** Malaggar investigates the smaller dining room. He takes a faded tapestry depicting the ancient city of Auldbaern. Behind it, Clank reads graffiti scrawled in Dwarvish: *"The Screamers' wails are worse now. That black stuff's cursed, I tell you."*  
* **Kitchen (Area 12):** Malaggar finds two duergar cooks (Grumm and Torg) in a deep stupor.  
  * Rav'ithar identifies the substance they consumed as a potent distilled extract of "Peep's Slumber Fungus."  
  * Haribo incapacitates them further with a cloud of spores.  
  * Malaggar executes one of the cooks, Torg. The party decides to tie up the other, Grumm, for potential interrogation later.  
* **Cold Storeroom (Area 9):** Bentham explores the storeroom, identifying it as a primitive refrigeration unit using cold water piped from the Black Loch.

### **3\. A Poisoned Trap and a Vital Discovery**

* **Zintra's Near-Death Experience:** While searching the footlockers in the Guards' Quarters (Area 8), Zintra investigates a torn mattress. Reaching inside, her hand is pricked by a poisoned needle trap. She immediately falls unconscious, her life fading.  
* **Haribo's Rescue:** Haribo rushes to her side, diagnoses a fast-acting respiratory poison, and uses Lesser Restoration to save her life, forcing a piece of his own fungal body into her mouth to counteract the toxin.  
* **The Researcher's Notebook:** The party carefully cuts open the booby-trapped mattress and discovers a blood-stained, leather-bound journal wrapped in oiled cloth. Clank reads the Dwarvish script, revealing it to be the research notebook of **Tharn Deep-Spire**. Its contents include:  
  * **D没mril Corruption:** Confirmation that the Black Mithril (D没mril) is psychically unstable and is poisoning the foundry's creations without proper purification.  
  * **Purification Recipe:** A precise alchemical formula to purify the metal, requiring holy water, powdered sapphire, and drow blood.  
  * **The True Source:** The location of the primary D没mril cache is a sealed vault within the royal catacombs on **Cairnhollow Isle**. A lighthouse on the isle serves as a marker.  
  * **A Spy in the Ranks:** A coded message, deciphered by Clank, reveals a warning: *"Glutthras seeks the binding code. They have a spy in Clan Fire-Beard. The old seals must not be broken. \-T.D.S."*  
  * **An Ally's Plea:** A final message addressed to House T'alzar, indicating Tharn was an ally trying to stop the weaponization of the corrupted D没mril.  
* **Looting the Quarters:** Zintra, once recovered, finishes looting the footlockers, finding various minor potions, gold, silver, gems, and another crude map of the foundry.

### **4\. The Creature in the Latrine**

* The party investigates a locked door marked with a Dwarvish warning: *"Grudni's curse upon the fool who enters. Out of order."*  
* Clank forces the door open, revealing a latrine. From the bubbling filth, a horribly mutated **Otyugh** leaps out to attack. Its hide is covered in the same black metal veins seen on the Screamers.  
* **A Surprise Alliance:** Instead of fighting, Malaggar successfully uses Speak with Animals to calm the creature. The Otyugh, tormented by its condition, reveals key intelligence:  
  * There are secret "squeeze cracks" and tunnels under the main forge floor.  
  * It knows of the "Screamer makers" and the "peak fire time" when the forge is at its hottest and the lead priest performs his rituals.  
* **A Merciful Cure:** Haribo, using his unique myconid knowledge, realizes the Otyugh's sores are from Black Mithril poisoning. He applies a special salve, curing the creature's pain.  
* **A New Friend:** The grateful Otyugh, now free from its agony, is fed rations and the corpse of the duergar cook Torg. It pledges its loyalty to the party, offering to guide them.

### **5\. Grumble's Grand Entrance**

* As the party plans their next move, the massive siege drill operated by their ally, **Grumble**, bursts through the *floor* of the cold storeroom (Area 9\) in a shower of stone and splintered barrels.  
* Grumble has successfully tunneled into the foundry, creating a secure, direct route to the middle level from the outside.

### **6\. The Path Forward**

* The party now has two potential paths to the upper levels: the main lift or the secret pipe network revealed by the Otyugh.  
* They decide the pipe network is the stealthier option. The pipes are filled with noxious fumes.  
* **Session End:** Haribo crafts makeshift gas masks from his mushroom components for the non-myconid party members. The team, now allied with a loyal Otyugh and with Grumble providing a secure exit, prepares to climb the treacherous, fume-filled pipes to the upper levels of the foundry to confront the leadership and rescue Valandor.
