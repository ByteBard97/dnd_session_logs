# **Session 8 Quest Log: Into the Guts of the Foundry**

### An Unexpected Threat

* The session began with the party having just been rejoined by their ally, Grumble, who had smashed through a wall in the cold storeroom with his siege drill.
* As the party discussed their next move, they heard chittering and clattering sounds coming from the direction of the docks.
* Zintra peeked through a window and spotted two Duergar Kavalrachni (dwarves riding large, spider-like creatures called Steeders) descending from the level above. They landed on the decks of the boats moored at the dock and began investigating.
* After a discussion about Drow opinions on the Duergar's use of Steeders, the party decided to engage the new enemies, planning to lure them into the room to be killed.

### Combat at the Docks

* **Round 1:**
    * Combat was initiated when one of the Duergar Kavalrachni fired a heavy crossbow bolt at Malagar, which struck the table in front of him. Malagar used his reaction to flip the table over for cover.
    * Ravathar went first, firing his pistol down the hallway and instantly killing one of the Duergar riders with a critical hit for 27 damage.
    * Malagar moved 10 feet and then climbed 20 feet up a column to the ceiling. From there, he cast *Hail of Thorns* and fired his bow, hitting the other rider for 12 damage. The thorns erupted, hitting the rider and both Steeders; they took 3 piercing damage each after failing their saving throws. His two subsequent attacks missed.
    * The surviving Kavalrachni moved up and threw a smoke grenade into the guard room where Clank was located, filling it with a 20-foot radius sphere of fog.
    * Grumble cast "Existential Dread" on the Kavalrachni rider, delivering a demoralizing monologue about the futility of his actions. The rider failed his saving throw and took 6 psychic damage.
    * A nearby Steeder fired a crossbow bolt at Malagar, but missed. Another Steeder fired through a murder hole at Zintra, hitting her.
    * Haribo used his action to have his Myconid Sprout use its chill touch on one of the Kavalrachni, hitting for 7 necrotic damage and preventing it from healing.
    * Zintra used her Cunning Action to hide, then fired her shortbow with advantage, hitting a Duergar for 17 damage and killing him. She then hid again.
    * Inside the fog cloud, Clank was disoriented but fired his recently acquired Fire Lance out of the murder hole, scaring the Steeders.

* **Round 2:**
    * The remaining Kavalrachni rider was poisoned by a trap that Clank had previously set up. Clank then made a dramatic dive out of the smoke-filled room to attack the Steeder with his Fire Lance, hitting for 5 piercing damage but fumbling his landing and falling prone next to Grumble.
    * On the ceiling, Malagar moved to a new position and again used *Hail of Thorns* with a longbow shot, destroying a Steeder. The thorns hit two other male Steeders for 7 damage each. He killed the last Steeder with his final arrow shot.
    * Zintra climbed 60 feet up the exterior wall to pursue a Kavalrachni that was fleeing upwards. She shot her bow and hit the Steeder he was riding, causing it and the rider to fall off the wall and splash into the water below.
    * The final Kavalrachni rider fled 60 feet up the cliff and disappeared onto the level above.

### Interrogation and Scouting

* The party turned their attention to the Duergar Kavalrachni who was struggling in the water, weighed down by his armor. Haribo offered to help him if he surrendered, which he did.
* Once out of the water, the party interrogated him. He confirmed that only the bosses carry the rods to open the cell and that the easiest one to take would be the Director, who could be found behind a "pretty," nice-looking door upstairs.
* After getting the information, Malagar kicked the captive back into the water, and Haribo finished him off with a booming blade cantrip.
* While the interrogation was happening, Malagar and Zintra climbed the exterior wall to scout the upper level. They witnessed Acolyte Goron and the Master Smith completing a ritual, pouring magma into a suit of armor to create a Screamer while a dwarf screamed inside. Seeing that the two bosses were magically enlarged, they retreated.

### Infiltrating the Foundry's Heart

* The party decided their best route was through the pipe system their Otyugh ally, Atiog, had shown them.
* They climbed into the labyrinth of pipes, a journey of 60-70 feet. The party overcame several hazards:
    * They navigated a cloud of noxious green gas.
    * They had to pass a vent spitting hot steam; Malagar and Clank both failed their checks and took fire damage, while the others passed successfully.
* Atiog led them to a loose grate in the ceiling of a storeroom. Through the grate, they could see the Quaggoth, Ogg, and a Duergar Stone Guard complaining about chafing and ointments.
* The party waited in the pipes for 20 minutes until Ogg and the guard left the storeroom.

### Cliffhanger in the Office

* The party climbed out of the grate into the now-empty storeroom.
* Malagar cast *Pass Without a Trace* to aid their stealth. Bentham, in the guise of Alyxina Firebeard, snuck to the Director's office door and listened, hearing only the horrifying, echoing screams of a Screamer.
* Zintra successfully picked the lock on the ornate office door.
* The party rushed inside and found themselves confronting Director Koldar and a drow woman, Liaison Malexa.
* Koldar immediately yelled, "Get in here! There's intruders!" and began ringing an alarm bell.
* Zintra recognized Malexa as a known mercenary spy from her time on the streets.
* The session ended in this tense standoff.
