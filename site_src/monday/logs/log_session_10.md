# Session 10

## **Quest Update:**
The party took a short rest to recover from the battle in the Director's office. During this time, all members leveled up.

## **Session Events & Discoveries**

### **1. Looting the Director's Quarters & Office**

The party conducted a thorough search of Director Koldar's private chambers and office.

**Looting the Fallen:**
- **Director Koldar:** The party recovered 33 gp, 21 sp, a magical Clan Fire-Beard signet ring, a key to his private chest, and a **Rod of Opening**.
- **Liaison Malexa:** The party recovered 115 gp, a disguise kit, magical bracers, a stiletto, and an arcane key for her yacht, the *Silk-Reaver*.

**The Private Bedroom (Area 7):**
- **Zyntra** used Koldar's key to open a locked chest.
- **Loot:** 80 gp, 120 sp, and a flask of fine dwarven whiskey.
- **Clue:** A journal titled "**Ledger of Abandoned Holdings**" was found, containing Koldar's notes on various Clan Fire-Beard mining operations around the Black Loch.
- **Clue:** A map of **Cairnhollow Isle** was discovered. Dwarvish annotations marked the "Catacombs of Aldebaran" and noted the location as a source of "**Dumro**" (the Dwarvish term for Black Mithril).

**The Main Office (Area 6):**
- **Zyntra** approached the large iron safe, identifying a sophisticated petrification trap on its runic lock. She rolled a 29 on her Thieves' Tools check, successfully bypassing the trap and opening the safe.
- **Loot:**
  - The foundry payroll: a large sack containing **1,000 gp**.
  - A small sack filled with a variety of **flawless gems** (star ruby, emerald, alexandrites, etc.).
  - A heavy, lead-lined box containing two shards of **raw, unprocessed black ore**.
- **Clues:**
  - A ledger was found detailing that the gems were intended as **bribes** for various officials—including Malexa and Vlyn'darastyl customs agents—to ensure the secrecy and success of the Screamer project.
  - A second, half-burnt maritime chart of **Cairnhollow Isle** was discovered. Its annotations suggested the tomb of the last dwarven king, Aron II, holds an artifact of pure Dûmril and confirmed that **House Glutthraz** is also interested in the site.
  - A magically sealed and coded letter was recovered.

### **2. Unsealing the Letter**

- **Zyntra** detected a magical ward on the letter's wax seal, originating from Koldar's signet ring.
- **Rav'ithar** successfully cast *Dispel Magic*, causing the wax seal to dissolve into dust and breaking the magical ward.
- The letter's contents were written in a Dwarvish cipher. **Clank**, with a roll of 26 on Investigation, successfully deciphered the code.
- **Clue - The Letter's Contents:** The letter was a report from Director Koldar to the "Honored Overlord" of Clan Fire-Beard.
  - It confirmed the alliance with House Glutthraz is strained, citing their impatience and late payments.
  - It revealed the Dûmril (Black Mithril) is inherently unstable without proper preparation, a detail the drow partners ignore.
  - It stated that Valandor T'alzar was resisting interrogation about the metal's properties, and Koldar feared the drow's methods would kill him before his knowledge could be extracted.

### **3. Exploring the Upper Levels**

The party moved to the upper level to investigate the remaining rooms.

**The Screamer Workshop (Area 2):**
- The room was identified as the assembly point for the Screamer constructs. It contained three empty Screamer suits, a disassembled prototype, and various tools.
- **Loot:** A significant cache of mithril plates, adamantine components, psionic resonators, and masterwork tools was secured. **Grumble** found a cart and, with **Haribo's** help, began loading the valuable materials for extraction.
- **Total Workshop Value:** **4,200+ gold pieces** worth of materials and tools.
- **Loot:** Four heavy, canvas-like **fire-resistant work suits** were found. The party determined these suits would grant resistance to fire damage and allow safe passage near the extreme heat of the main forge.

**The Bunk Room (Area 1):**
- The party found graffiti scrawled in Dwarvish on the wall: *"Cursed metal—makes the Screamers scream louder."* This confirmed the workers' fear and superstition regarding the Black Mithril.

### **4. The Prison of Valandor**

- The party returned to the lower level and approached the sealed adamantine door.
- Using the **Rod of Opening** recovered from Koldar, the party touched it to an impression on the door. A disembodied voice whispered the command phrase, "*Uzkul-Darak-Thoon*" ("By stone, bone, and crushing debt"), which deactivated the magical wards.
- Inside, they discovered a grim interrogation cell and the body of **Valandor T'alzar**. He had been deceased for one to two days. His mechanical spider companion, **Spinneret**, lay smashed on the floor nearby.
- **Clank** used his Artificer skills to repair Spinneret, successfully activating a crystal memory shard within.
  - **Clue - Valandor's Final Message:** The shard projected a final message from Valandor. He revealed he gave his captors no information and chose death to protect his family, especially his daughter, Miraleth. He urged the party to "Find the surface. Claim what was always ours," and to protect the family above all else.
- **Haribo** cast *Gentle Repose* on Valandor's body to preserve it for transport. The spell was initially suppressed by an unknown magical influence within the cell but took hold once the body was moved outside the room.

### **5. Strategic Considerations**

**Available Resources:**
- **Malexa's yacht (*Silk-Reaver*)** with arcane key - faster than the duergar barge but traceable to House Glutthraz
- **Massive haul of valuable materials** being loaded by Grumble
- **Fire-resistant suits** for safely approaching the main forge
- **Demolition charges** for potential sabotage

**Immediate Threats:**
- **Clan Fire-Beard will return** when expected deliveries stop coming
- The foundry's remaining defenses and the **trapped geothermal elemental**
- Potential pursuit by House Glutthraz forces

**Tactical Options Discussed:**
- **Sabotage the foundry:** Release the elemental, trigger demolition charges, or collapse the main access
- **Use Bentham's abilities:** With Malexa's form, he could potentially infiltrate or misdirect enemies
- **Extract via multiple routes:** The yacht for speed, the barge for cargo capacity, or overland via Grumble's drill

## **Session End**

The party now stands victorious, having eliminated the foundry's leadership and recovered a trove of crucial intelligence. They have secured Valandor's remains and possess damning evidence of the secret, strained alliance between Clan Fire-Beard and House Glutthraz.

**Key Intelligence Gained:**
- **Cairnhollow Isle** contains the main source of Dûmril in ancient royal catacombs
- **House Glutthraz** is actively competing for the same prize
- The **Screamer project** relies on improperly prepared Black Mithril
- **Clan Fire-Beard** is being exploited by their drow "partners"

**Mission Status:** The rescue mission has become a **revenge operation**. With Valandor's final message pointing toward "the surface forge," the party must now decide how to escape the foundry, extract their considerable loot, and prepare for the next phase of their quest to protect House T'alzar and claim their ancestral rights to the Dûmril cache.

The immediate challenge: **How to best sabotage the foundry to deny its resources to their enemies and safely extract with their discoveries.**
