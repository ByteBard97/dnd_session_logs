<link rel="stylesheet" href="../drow_theme.css">

## Overview

The drow pantheon, known as the Dark Seldarine, encompasses far more than just the Spider Queen. While Lolth dominates drow religious life, six other deities play crucial roles in the complex spiritual landscape of the Underdark. Understanding these divine influences helps explain the religious and political tensions that define drow civilization.

## **Lolth, the Spider Queen**

### **Primary Deity**
