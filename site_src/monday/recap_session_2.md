# Session 2

Welcome back to the Underdark. When last we left our heroes, you had been entrusted with the most critical mission your house has ever faced.

### **The Price of Failure**

You stood in a makeshift war room before your Matron Mother, Severine T'alzar. She spoke with the cold precision of a chess master, but with the barely concealed strain of a mother on the edge of a precipice. Her son, your brother Valandor, was missing—his research into a revolutionary alloy called "Black Mithril" had led him to the Duergar of Cinderfork Foundry, and he had not returned . Your orders were clear: infiltrate the foundry, find Valandor, and Rescue him at any cost. Failure, she made clear, was not an option.

The weight of this mission was made heartbreakingly real when the doors burst open and in rushed Miraleth, Valandor's young daughter. Clutching a broken clockwork spider, she spoke of a terrible dream—of fire, hammers, and her father calling for help. You promised her you would bring him home, a vow that now hangs over your journey.

### **The Workshop of Secrets**

Guided by your sister, the spymaster Lirael, you made your way to Valandor's secret workshop to retrieve a powerful siege drill for the mission. After bypassing the guardian construct "Nugget," you discovered the strange wonders within. You found Valandor's "Oculo-Metalloscope," learning that his research into Black Mithril was tied to the ancient "Catacombs of Aldebaran," the dwarven ruins upon which your very city was built.

More unsettling was the creature in the massive vat: a telepathic Underdark shark named "Teeth in Dark," an agitated test subject for Valandor's experiments. While the others investigated, Malagar ventured to the market, returning with a bounty of fresh fish. You fed the lonely, hungry predator, calming it and forging an unexpected bond of trust .

### **A Procession of Lies**

With the massive drill needing transport, Lirael devised a cunning plan. Using her magic, she cloaked the machine in an illusion, transforming it into a grand, obsidian statue of the goddess Lolth. You and your companions became somber temple attendants, forming a religious procession to move through the city unnoticed.

Your deception was tested twice. First, by a drunken noble who you expertly intimidated into leaving your "holy relic" alone . Next, you were accosted by the "Rust Rats," a vicious street gang demanding a toll . Reading their leader's mind and choosing discretion over violence, you paid the bribe, ensuring your cover remained intact as you continued your silent march through the city's dark streets.

### **The Ferrymen**

You finally arrived at a forgotten wharf on the edge of the city. There, your transport awaited: a low skiff captained by the grim Orog, Borok the Silent, and his chattering goblin priest, Fadda Brinebless . Lirael dropped the illusion, wished you luck, and melted back into the shadows, leaving you to your fate. After loading the drill, you boarded the vessel, which is pulled not by oars or sail, but by two monstrous, chained Keelhauler eels.

And that is where we find you now. On a boat captained by a silent brute, pulled by monsters across the vast, dark waters of the Black Loch. The lights of Vlyn'darastyl fade behind you, and ahead lies only darkness, and the smoke and fire of Cinderfork Foundry. Your mission has truly begun.
