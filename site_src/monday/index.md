## Looking for New Players

We are currently looking for players to join our Monday night D&D 5e campaign. If you found this site via a QR code, welcome!

### The Pitch
What if you were the other side of the story? Join a drow noble house of magical artificers on a desperate mission. This campaign runs parallel to "Lost Mine of Phandelver," but from the villain's point of view.

**Like Drizzt's Homeland**: Experience the Underdark from the inside. You'll navigate the brutal hierarchy of drow society, where family loyalty is paramount and betrayal lurks around every corner. [House T'alzar](locations/talzar_tower.md), like House Do'Urden, must balance survival with maintaining their principles in a society that rewards cruelty.

**Like Dune**: Political intrigue and resource scarcity drive the narrative. Your house specializes in magical artifice—a rare and valuable skill that makes you both essential and a target. Like the spice melange, your house's unique capabilities are coveted by rival houses. Navigate complex alliances, manage limited resources, and uncover plots within plots.

**Like Game of Thrones**: Multiple factions vie for power while a greater threat looms. Each noble house has its own agenda, and today's ally may be tomorrow's enemy. Your choices have lasting consequences, and no character is safe from the machinations of drow politics. The campaign features morally gray characters, unexpected betrayals, and the constant question: will you play the game or change it?

This campaign begins in the treacherous depths of the Underdark, where your house fights for survival against rival drow nobles, mind flayers, and worse. Eventually, your desperate mission will lead you to the surface world near Phandalin, where you'll encounter the "heroes" of the traditional Lost Mine of Phandelver story—but from a very different perspective.

### The Vibe
*   A balance of combat, exploration, and roleplay.
*   Morally complex characters with personal stakes.
*   Family loyalty, politics, and difficult choices.
*   Playing characters who aren't traditional heroes but have believable motivations.

### Who We're Looking For
*   Reliable players (21+) who can commit to weekly sessions
*   Those excited by moral complexity and political intrigue

### Your Character
Your character will be an integral part of [House T'alzar's](locations/talzar_tower.md) fight for survival. We prioritize a compelling character concept over any specific role or class—all are welcome.
