## Overview

**Name:** The Lost Catacombs of Auldbaern  
**Type:** Ancient Dwarven Burial Site  
**Location:** Cairnhollow Isle (now within Vlyn'darastyl)  
**Status:** Sealed for 1,200 years, untouched and intact  

## Historical Significance

The Lost Catacombs represent the final resting place of Auldbaern's nobility, including the tomb of King Aron II, the last dwarven ruler before the drow conquest. These sacred burial chambers hold not only the remains of dwarven royalty but also crucial clues to ancient forging techniques and the connections to Black Mithril research that drive the campaign's central mysteries.

## The Fall of Auldbaern

### **The Last King**
**King Aron II** died defending his city against the drow invasion 1,200 years ago. His loyal royal guard managed to recover his body and transport it to the pre-constructed royal tomb, where he was interred according to ancient dwarven traditions.

### **The Sealing**
After placing the king in his elaborate sarcophagus and performing the final rites, the last royal guardsman sealed the catacombs by dragging heavy stone slabs over the entrance. This loyal soldier remains the last person to enter the sacred burial site.

### **Preservation**
Unlike other burial sites on Cairnhollow Isle that have been plundered or collapsed over the centuries, the catacombs remain largely intact due to their concealed entrance and the respect (or fear) that even drow show for certain ancient sites.
