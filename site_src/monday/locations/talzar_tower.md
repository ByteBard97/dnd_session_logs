### Atmosphere & General Description
The main entrance to T'alzar Tower is designed to impress and intimidate. Carved directly into the cavern rock, the massive entryway is dominated by the looming form of **Veridia, the Jade Spider Sentinel**, a house guardian of jade and dark metal. The air is cool and still, carrying the faint scent of polished stone and ozone from nearby magical wards. Echoes are sharp here.

*Dedicated to Lolth, where the family performs their devotions*

### Atmosphere & General Description
A palpable sense of prescribed formality, rather than fervent devotion, permeates this level.

### Atmosphere & General Description
These are the private chambers of Matron Mother Severine T'alzar, reflecting her supreme authority, formidable intellect, and mastery of the arcane arts. The atmosphere is one of oppressive quiet, sharp intelligence, and the subtle thrum of contained magical energies. Any devotion to Lolth is secondary here, a tool rather than a conviction.
