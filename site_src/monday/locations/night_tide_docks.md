## Overview
**Name:** Night-Tide Docks  
**Type:** Abandoned Wharf District  
**Location:** Lower wards of Vlyn'darastyl  
**Status:** Largely forgotten, used for clandestine activities  

## Description
The Night-Tide Docks represent the forgotten maritime past of Vlyn'darastyl's lower districts. Once a bustling freight pier, this area has fallen into disrepair and now serves as a meeting point for those who prefer to conduct business away from prying eyes.

## Physical Features

### The Old Wharf
- **Rotting Planks** - Warped wooden walkways thick with pale moss
- **Leaning Bollards** - Ancient mooring posts weathered by time
- **Rusted Chains** - Remnants of heavy cargo operations
- **Collapsed Sections** - Dangerous gaps in the pier structure

### Abandoned Warehouses
- **Bricked Windows** - Sealed against intrusion and observation
- **Chained Doors** - Heavy locks securing empty storage spaces
- **Moss-Covered Walls** - Barnacle-scarred stone structures
- **Hidden Entrances** - Secret ways for those who know them

### The Meeting Point
Where House Vaerixas conducts sensitive operations:
- **Single Witch-Light Lantern** - Guttering illumination for rendezvous
- **Covered Archway** - Roofless entry from the main streets
- **Mooring Space** - Where the *Silent Keel* awaits passengers
- **Concealed Sightlines** - Natural cover from city watch patrols

## Atmospheric Details

### Sounds
- **Rusted Bells** - Clanging softly in the cold underground wind
- **Creaking Timbers** - Groaning under their own deteriorated weight
- **Lapping Water** - Gentle waves against the rotting pier supports
- **Distant Echoes** - Voices and activity from the active port districts

### Smells
- **Salt and Brine** - Lingering scents from the Black Loch
- **Rust and Decay** - Metallic tang of corroding equipment
- **Damp Stone** - Moisture seeping through aged masonry
- **Fungal Growth** - Mushrooms and molds claiming abandoned spaces

## Strategic Importance

### Clandestine Operations
- **Secret Meetings** - Away from house surveillance networks
- **Smuggling Routes** - Discrete cargo transfer points
- **Emergency Extraction** - Quick escape routes to the Black Loch
- **Information Exchange** - Neutral ground for sensitive negotiations

### The Vaerixas Connection
House Vaerixas uses these docks for:
- **Mission Launches** - Departure point for sensitive operations
- **Equipment Transfer** - Moving large items like siege drills
- **Contact Meetings** - Rendezvous with independent operators
- **Plausible Deniability** - Operations that can't be traced to the house

## The Ferrymen's Berth
This specific pier serves as the regular station for:
- **Borok the Silent** - The Orog ferryman and his vessel
- **The *Silent Keel*** - Low-profile skiff for dangerous crossings
- **Emergency Services** - Evacuation routes when needed
- **Supply Drops** - Receiving goods from Black Loch traders

## Security Considerations

### Natural Concealment
- **Low Visibility** - Witch-light provides minimal illumination
- **Sound Dampening** - Water and stone muffle conversations
- **Multiple Exits** - Various escape routes through the district
- **Crowd Avoidance** - Far from busy commercial areas

### Risks
- **Structural Collapse** - Rotting infrastructure poses physical danger
- **Criminal Activity** - Other groups may use the area for illegal purposes
- **Patrol Sweeps** - Occasional city watch investigations
- **Rival Surveillance** - Enemy houses monitoring for Vaerixas activity

## The Illusion Operation
During the siege drill transport:
- **Seeming Spell** - Disguised the drill as a religious statue
- **Procession Route** - Path through city to reach these docks
- **Cover Story** - Temple ceremony to explain the movement
- **Quick Transition** - Rapid loading once illusion was dropped
