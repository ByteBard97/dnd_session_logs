# Cinderfork Foundry

<link rel="stylesheet" href="../drow_theme.css">

## Overview
**Name:** Cinderfork Foundry  
**Type:** Industrial Complex  
**Location:** Across the Black Loch from Vlyn'darastyl  
**Controlled By:** Duergar, contracted with House Glutthraz  

## Description
Cinderfork Foundry is a massive duergar industrial complex that serves as both a manufacturing facility and a prison. The foundry specializes in producing magical constructs called "Screamers" and has become central to the conflict between Houses T'alzar and Glutthraz.

**DM Modification Note:** *This Tom Cartos water wheel map was adapted for the foundry by converting the lake into a moonpool, removing surface vegetation, and reimagining the paddle wheel as a steam-powered turbine system driven by a bound geothermal elemental.*

#### The Steam Turbine Chamber
The centerpiece of the geothermal plant is a massive steam-powered turbine that has replaced the original water wheel. Cool water pumped from the Black Loch feeds into a specialized chamber containing the [Bound Geothermal Elemental](../npcs/generated/bound_geothermal_elemental.md). The elemental's intense heat converts this water into superheated steam under extreme pressure, which then drives the turbine system.

#### The Gearing Rooms
Multiple interconnected chambers house an elaborate system of gears and mechanical power transmission equipment. These gear rooms distribute the turbine's mechanical energy throughout the foundry, powering forges, hammers, and other industrial equipment. Numerous control levers throughout these areas allow operators to adjust steam flow, gear ratios, and power distribution to different sections of the facility.

#### Steam Venting System
A complex network of pipes and venting controls manages the flow of steam throughout the system. Multiple levers positioned around the plant control both the steam generation rate and the pressure release mechanisms. Operators can redirect steam flow, increase or decrease turbine speed, and manage the overall power output of the facility.

#### The Moonpool
What appears as rushing white water around the turbine is actually a carefully controlled mix of steam and water discharge. The original lake has been converted into an underwater moonpool that connects directly to the Black Loch, allowing for both water intake and covert access to the facility. Infiltrators using magical diving gear (such as a Cloak of the Manta Ray) can swim up through this underwater entrance.

#### Research Cottage
Located in the lower section of the complex, this residential area houses [Alyxina Fire-Beard](../npcs/generated/alyxina_fire_beard.md) and her husband [Chief Researcher Korvun](../npcs/generated/chief_researcher_korvun.md). The cottage serves as both living quarters and a private research facility for their work on magical constructs and arcane metallurgy.

#### Plant Operations
The entire geothermal system is overseen by [Chief Engineer Tholdrum "Steam-Heart" Garn](../npcs/generated/chief_engineer_tholdrum_steam_heart_garn.md), who manages day-to-day operations and maintenance. The plant requires constant monitoring to maintain optimal steam pressure, prevent mechanical failures, and ensure the elemental binding remains stable.

**Tactical Considerations:** Infiltrators face a complex challenge - they must either find a way to disable or slow the turbine system to pass safely through the steam-filled areas, or risk freeing the bound elemental, which would eliminate the steam hazard but trigger foundry-wide alarms alerting all personnel to the breach.

### Power Distribution Hub
- Central control for foundry power systems receiving energy from the geothermal plant
- Site of major battle with Chief Engineer
- Critical junction for all mechanical power throughout the facility

## Security Features
- Adamantine-reinforced prison cells
- Triple-lock system requiring three Rods of Opening
- Armed duergar guards and patrols
- Industrial hazards and automated defenses

## Current Situation
The foundry is currently under infiltration by House T'alzar operatives seeking to rescue the imprisoned Valandor. Several key personnel have been eliminated, and major systems have been compromised.

## Products
- **Screamers** - Magical construct soldiers
- **Industrial equipment** - Various duergar crafted items
- **Research materials** - Black Mithril processing and analysis
