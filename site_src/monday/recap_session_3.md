# Session 3

### **The Black Loch Crossing & A Glimmer of Hope**

Last we left our drow operatives, the lights of Vlyn'darastyl were fading behind you as the *Silent Keel* cut through the inky waters of the Black Loch. Borok the Silent, the grim orog ferryman, steered with an unspoken authority, his grip tight on his axe-shaped tiller. Fadda Brinebless, the chattering goblin priest, sprinkled sacred loch water, whispering blessings for a safe passage. The monstrous Keelhauler eels, tethered to the skiff, pulled with eerie quietness, their blind white eyes occasionally glinting in the dim light.

Your journey through the abyssal depths proved as perilous as prophesied. First, the *Silent Keel* was forced to navigate around treacherous **hydrothermal vents ** , plumes of superheated steam rising from the water, hinting at the duergar patrols that favored their warmth. Later, a chilling spectral sight emerged from the gloom: a **Ghost Barge** , its translucent timbers and silent, toiling figures a grim omen of unending labor. You watched it pass, a stark reminder of the Underdark's cruelties.

Then, a profound stillness descended upon the loch, and a sickly green glow pulsed from the depths – the **Whisperer's Omen** . Fadda, trembling with terror, implored your aid in a desperate ritual. Through combined efforts, channeling arcane energy, steadying the vessel, and offering symbolic sacrifices, you managed to calm the restless entity, earning a rare, approving grunt from Borok himself.

### **The Cinderfork Sub-Level: Discovery and Bloodshed**

As you neared Cinderfork Foundry, its fiery glow stained the water ahead, and the bone-deep thrum of its machinery resonated through the very rock. Your infiltration plan, a daring underwater approach, was initiated. Haribo, shrouded in invisibility and transformed into a bat, scouted ahead.

Your aerial reconnaissance revealed the grim heart of duergar industry. At the docks, you saw a slow duergar barge, a drow yacht, and, ominously, **Valandor's own speedboat, the *Night-Talon* **. Inside the foundry's main level, you glimpsed off-duty workers and, more disturbing, the gruesome assembly of ** Screamers**, with duergar being forced into metallic suits by a grim priest and master smith. You even overheard workers grumbling about Valandor, referring to him as "the drow prisoner, the artificer," and hinting that "they finally broke the prisoner today". The Peepers, the foundry's anti-invisibility constructs, also lurked, a threat to your stealth.

Descending to the moonpool, you surfaced in a warm, humid cavern, the thrumming of the massive turbine deafening. Your first target: a deceptively cozy cottage on the sub-level. Bentham, still in his natural form, led the way, ambushing **Alyxina Fire-Beard ** , the researcher's wife, as she cooked. After a brief interrogation, Malagar, with brutal efficiency, **slit her throat** , and Bentham dragged the body into a nearby storage room, which was then looted for supplies and spare parts. Haribo, meanwhile, befriended Alyxina's pet cave spider, Skitter, by offering it fresh rat blood.

Next, you moved to the upper level of the cottage, where **Chief Researcher Korvun** worked in his study. Bentham, now shape-shifted into Alyxina's form, attempted a deception, introducing the party as "college friends". Though Korvun was suspicious, the ruse held long enough for the ambush. Ramon paralyzed him with *Hold Person*, and Haribo poisoned him with spores. While Zyntra accidentally triggered an alarm by failing to disarm a trap on a locked chest, Korvun, under duress, finally revealed the location of Valandor: imprisoned upstairs, behind a heavy **adamantine door ** requiring special "rods of unlocking" held by the three foundry bosses. As the information was extracted, Zyntra disarmed the alarm and the chest's gas trap. With a final, chilling act, Bentham ** executed Korvun**, delivering a parting taunt about his murdered wife.

From Korvun's hidden chest, you secured invaluable finds: three **Dûmril Ingots ** (Black Mithril) stamped with the ancient Auldbaern symbol, proving their origin in the royal catacombs; a ** Prototype Resonance Lens **, capable of detecting thoughts; and a damning letter from ** Director Koldar** (sealed with House Glutthraz wax) demanding increased Screamer output, confirming your rivals' deep involvement. You also found a manual on "Transmutation" and a note hinting at the "Deep-Spire map" for the true source of Dûmril.

With Korvun and Alyxina silenced, the truth of Valandor's fate is clearer than ever: he is alive, albeit imprisoned, and his research is central to the horrific Screamer project. You now possess the means to potentially stop this grim production, armed with critical intelligence and samples of the very Black Mithril that fuels the duergar's monstrous creations. The stage is set for the next phase of your infiltration, with Valandor's rescue, and vengeance, within your grasp.
