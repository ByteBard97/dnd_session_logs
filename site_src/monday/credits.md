## Maps by Milby's Maps

We extend our heartfelt thanks to **Milby's Maps** for the incredible foundational maps that bring our drow campaign to life:

### Campaign Location Maps
- **Cinderfork Foundry** - The industrial duergar foundry where our heroes infiltrate to rescue Valandor
- **Vlyn'darastyl** - The annotated map of the drow city, home to House Vaerixas and the setting for political intrigue
- **The Black Loch Region** - The treacherous underground lake that our party crosses to reach their destination

**Source:** [Milby's Maps](https://www.milbysmaps.com/)  
**Artist:** Milby  
**Usage:** Licensed for tabletop RPG use

These professional-quality maps have been instrumental in creating the atmospheric and tactical depth of our campaign. The detailed artwork helps players visualize the dangerous industrial complex of Cinderfork Foundry, the gothic spires of the drow city, and the vast, monster-haunted waters of the Black Loch.

### Old Wharf Docks
**Maps:** Abandoned dock complex used for the party's clandestine departure
