# Session 8 Recap: Into the Belly of the Beast
"When we last left our agents of House T'alzar, three massive explosions had just rocked Cinderfork Foundry as your trap claimed its victims. The mess hall lay silent, bodies cooling in their own blood, while tons of rubble now sealed the main stairwell above.

With Grumble having burst through the cold storeroom wall with his siege drill—ruining several barrels of pickled eels in the process—you finally had both a secure exit and your most formidable ally at your side.

But your moment of victory was short-lived. Chittering sounds echoed from the docks as two Duergar Kavalrachni descended from above, their spider-like Steeders carrying them down the walls to investigate the carnage. What followed was a vicious battle across multiple levels. Ravathar's pistol sang death, Malagar danced across the ceiling raining arrows and thorns, while Grumble crushed morale with existential dread. When the smoke cleared and the last rider plummeted into the dark waters, you extracted vital intelligence from the drowning survivor: only three bosses carry the Rods of Opening—the chain-draped priest, the master hammersmith, and the Director behind his 'pretty door.'

Following your new ally Atiog—the grateful Otyugh you'd healed of its Black Mithril poisoning—you climbed into the foundry's maze of waste pipes. Through scalding steam and noxious fumes, you ascended 60 feet through the industrial bowels of the fortress. After waiting twenty agonizing minutes for Ogg the Quaggoth and his companion to finish discussing ointments and leave, you emerged into a storeroom.

Meanwhile, Malagar and Zintra had scaled the exterior walls to scout above, witnessing the horrific completion of a Screamer—molten metal poured into armor while a Duergar screamed inside, the ritual overseen by two magically enlarged bosses.

Now, having picked the lock to Director Koldar's office, you've burst in to find him in tense negotiation with Liaison Malexa—a drow spy Zintra recognizes from the streets as a mercenary information broker who sells secrets to the highest bidder. The Director's alarm bell rings out: 'Intruders! Get in here!'

The office awaits—will you find answers about Valandor's fate, or will this become another bloodbath in your trail of vengeance through Cinderfork Foundry?
