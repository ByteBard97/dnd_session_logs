# Session 6 Recap

Let's return to the oppressive dark and the bone-deep thrum of the Cinderfork Foundry…

You stood victorious over the corpse of the Chief Engineer, but your path forward was blocked by a roaring wall of steel—a colossal turbine spinning with impossible speed. Your first attempt to cross with magic nearly pureed Haribo into a fine mushroom paste, a grim reminder of the stakes. But you are agents of House T'alzar, and you do not bow to brute force. With brutal efficiency, you seized the controls yourselves. A lever slammed, the foundry's arcane lights flickered to a sickly orange glow, and the deafening roar of the plant died to the groan of underpowered machinery. One by one, you leaped through the slowing, superheated blades, phantom shapes crossing into the dark.

You ascended. The next level was a mess hall, echoing with the drunken laughter of off-duty Duergar. But a higher staircase beckoned, and what you saw there froze the blood. You witnessed a chilling tableau of unholy industry: the main forge, where a captive's agonized pleas were drowned out by guttural chanting as he was prepared to be fused into a living metal suit—another screaming soul to be forged into a weapon.

This was a fight for another time. You made the cold, tactical decision to retreat, to purge the foundry from the bottom up. In the stairwell, you began to weave a web of death, rigging grenades to tripwires. Your work was interrupted by the approach of two guards. But chaos is your ally. Bentham, a vision of the murdered Alyxina, stalked up the stairs, hissing lies and orders that sent the confused guards right into Malaggar's waiting blades. A flash of steel in the dark, and two more bodies were silently pitched into the abyss below. The trap was set.

Then, you unleashed hell on the mess hall.

A bubble of absolute silence plunged the room into a deafening void. Vicious thorns erupted from the floor, sealing the elevator into a deathtrap. Before the Duergar could even comprehend the silent chaos, you descended upon them. Zyntra's dagger blazed with green fire, turning one guard to ash. Malaggar was a blur of motion, his Dread Ambusher strikes felling two more before they could even rise from their card game. Bentham was a phantom, his blade appearing from the shadows to deliver an automatic, critical blow that erased a guard captain from existence.

The room became a charnel house. You were a symphony of slaughter, moving from target to target, your blades and bolts finding every weakness. A flamethrower was silenced before it could fire; a mind-controller was riddled with crossbow bolts before he could enslave your will. One by one they fell, until the only sounds were the thud of your own heartbeats in the unnatural quiet.

The silence is yours. The floor is yours. The bodies are stacked and cooling. You stand in the calm eye of the storm you created, preparing to drink potions that will grant you a full rest in mere moments. And in that brief, bloody quiet…

**BOOM. BOOM. BOOM!**

Three distinct, violent explosions detonate from the stairwell directly above you. The trap has been sprung. The silence has been broken.

And now… you have company. What has come calling?
