# Session 5 Recap: The Engineer's Gambit and the Silent Turbine

When last we left our ruthless agents of House T'alzar, you were masters of a silent fortress. The sub-level was yours, its former guardians silenced and stacked in closets. But your path forward was blocked by a colossal, roaring turbine, a spinning wall of steel between you and your brother, **Valandor** .

Your next move was a study in brutal efficiency. You targeted the Gear Room, the control hub for the deadly machine. Ravi, cloaked in the guise of the slain Chief Researcher, and Malagar, disguised as a common guard, confronted the lone worker inside. Through clever deception, you learned the secrets of the levers—how to divert the steam, and more importantly, how to trigger a full system shutdown. The worker, having outlived his usefulness, was executed with cold precision, his body added to the growing pile.

With the controls understood, you set your sights on a greater prize: **Chief Engineer Tholdrum** , who you believed held one of the three keys to Valandor’s prison. What followed was a synchronized breach plan. From the catwalks above, Malagar and Zyntra prepared to rain death from above with grenades, while the rest of you prepared to storm the doors.

But no plan survives contact with the enemy—or a clumsy ally. Clank, misreading a cue, burst through the door prematurely, and the room exploded into chaos. Grenades fell, blasting Tholdrum's sentries to pieces and sending the Chief Engineer himself sprawling. You descended upon him, a whirlwind of steel and magic. But Tholdrum was no simple overseer. Enraged, he overcharged his massive steam hammer and, in a single, furious assault, crushed Ravi, leaving him on the brink of death.

It was a desperate fight. But after a quick heal from Haribo, you rallied. Malagar, a blur of motion, unleashed a relentless series of strikes, finally silencing the Chief Engineer in a fountain of his own blood.

You plundered his corpse, claiming his magical armor and a host of strange alchemical potions. But you also made a devastating discovery: Tholdrum did not have the key. The rod you seek is still out of reach.

And so we find you now, standing before the controls of the silent turbine. You have the power to shut it down completely, to create a path forward. But doing so will sound a foundry-wide alarm, bringing the full weight of the duergar down upon you in minutes. You face a terrible choice: Do you risk the shutdown, creating a desperate race against time? Or do you find another, more subtle way to weaponize the very machine that blocks your path? The silence of the sub-level is yours, but time is running out.
