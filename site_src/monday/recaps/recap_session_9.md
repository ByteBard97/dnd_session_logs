# Session 9 Recap: 
When last we left our ruthless agents of House T’alzar, the silence of the Director's office had just been shattered by the frantic ringing of an alarm bell. You stood face-to-face with your target, Director Koldar, and a deadly drow spy, Malexa. Before a single word of negotiation could be uttered, Malagar, recognizing the agent of a rival house, exploded into motion. A blur of gloomy air and flashing steel, he crossed the room in an instant, his blade biting deep into the spy’s shoulder. The battle for Cinderfork Foundry had begun.

While chaos erupted in the office, Haribo’s quick thinking turned the tide outside. Peeking through the keyhole, he saw a nightmare mustering in the forge—a monstrous Black Mithril Screamer flanked by giant-sized duergar, ready to storm your position. With a surge of primal power, he summoned a writhing, impenetrable *Wall of Thorns*, trapping your would-be executioners in a deadly embrace of magical briars.

But the foundry's horrors could not be contained for long. The Screamer, shrugging off the thorns, turned its industrial drill arm on your door, tearing through solid iron until it burst into the room. A bone-shattering sonic scream ripped through the air, blasting you from your feet, as a fanatical Acolyte stepped through the breach, his holy symbol radiating a palpable wave of terror that sent you fleeing for cover.

For a moment, all seemed lost. Pinned down, poisoned, and gripped by supernatural fear, you were on the brink of failure. But in the heart of chaos, you found your resolve. Ravithar, a phantom of vengeance slipping past the enemy lines while invisible, raised his pistol and fired. The shot echoed through the forge, and the Acolyte, the source of your terror, fell dead, his face melting in a river of molten lava.

That single act of defiance broke the enemy's spirit. Clank, seizing the fallen Director’s *Rod of Torment*, unleashed a blast of pure psychic energy into the Screamer, causing the construct to spasm and overload. It erupted in a shower of lightning before Malagar, with calculated fury, brought it crashing to the ground in a heap of broken metal and silenced screams.

Just as the last of the duergar tried to flee, the foundry elevator dinged, and Grumble arrived in his siege drill, a welcome vision of mechanical destruction. One by one, your remaining foes were pounded into fleshy piles of meat.

And that is where we find you now. You stand victorious in a ruined office, the bodies of your enemies cooling around you. The foundry is silent, its leaders dead, its greatest weapon a pile of scrap. You have the Rod of Torment, and Valandor’s prison is now within reach. But the cost was high—a trusted fungal sprout is dead, a valuable captive was lost in the crossfire, and somewhere, deeper in this fortress of iron and fire, Valandor still waits for a rescue that is long overdue.
