# Session 1 Recap

---

### **Previously, on Lost Mine of the Drow...**

We began in the oppressive darkness of Vlyn'darastyl, a city of treacherous light and shadow. You are the sworn agents of

 **House T'alzar** , a noble family of unparalleled artificers, whose legacy is being bled dry by the silent, economic war waged by your rivals, House Glutthraz. Your only hope lies with your brother,

 **Valandor** , who is on a desperate mission to the Cinderfork Foundry to unlock the secrets of a legendary alloy that could save you all.

Your story began with a summons from your sister, the devout and fearsome

 **Vyssinia** , to the fighting pits for a "practice session". But this was to be no simple sparring match. Before the analytical eyes of your other sister, the spymaster

 **Lirael** , Vyssinia declared that true devotion to the Spider Queen must be proven through trial and sacrifice. With a sharp command, the gates were opened, and a nightmare of chitin and madness was unleashed upon you—a

 **Drider** .

The battle that followed was a clash of wills as much as blades. As you fought for your lives, you were caught between your two sisters' warring philosophies.

From the gallery above, Vyssinia’s voice rang out, a torrent of zealous fervor, urging you to embrace the glory of combat. When you were struck, she declared it a gift from Lolth. "Pain is Lolth's gift\! Let it sharpen your hatred\!" she cried. When you dealt a blow, she roared her approval: "Yes\! Let its blood paint the sacred sand\!".

Meanwhile, Lirael’s voice cut through the chaos with cool, tactical precision. She offered you insights and bardic inspiration, chiding you when you faltered. "Predictable attack pattern. Adjust your defense\!" she would snap, before granting you the edge you needed to survive.

In the end, it was **Bentham** who delivered the final, fatal strike, felling the monstrous creature. As a reward for this display of brutal efficiency, Vyssinia presented you with a prize from her personal collection: the coveted

 **Amulet of Misty Step** .

The fight was over, but the conflict had just begun. The sisters descended and argued over the bloody spectacle. Vyssinia praised your violence as a holy sacrifice that would win the Spider Queen's favor. But Lirael revealed the truth: the Drider was a captured spy, an intelligence asset you had been forced to destroy, squandering a chance to learn more about your enemies' plans.

In the anxious days that followed, the mood in the tower grew heavy. Valandor was now officially late, and a palpable worry crept through the halls. Finally, the summons came—not to the fighting pits, but to the grand ballroom, which had been stripped of its finery and converted into a war room.

There, before maps of the Black Loch and strange arcane devices, stood your **Matron Mother, Severine T'alzar ** . With a voice like compressed steel, she delivered the dire news: Valandor was missing. All contact was lost. This was no longer a matter of waiting for good news. This was a **rescue mission** .

And that is where we find you now. Your Matron has laid out the plans, three desperate paths into the heart of an enemy fortress. The life of your brother and the very future of House T'alzar hang in the balance, and the choice of how to proceed is yours.
