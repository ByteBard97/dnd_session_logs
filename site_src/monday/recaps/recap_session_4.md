# Session 4 Recap

When last we left our ruthless agents of House T'alzar, you had drawn first blood in the Cinderfork Foundry, silencing the researchers in their own home. But the sub-level was far from secure, its halls still echoing with the clang of machinery and the tread of duergar boots. What followed was not a battle, but a systematic, chilling purge.

Your cottage became a slaughterhouse disguised as a sanctuary. One by one, you lured the foundry's personnel to their doom. First, the unsuspecting guard, **Borland Emberback** , drawn in by Bentham's flawless imitation of the now-dead Alyxina crying "fire!" He walked into a dark kitchen and was met not with smoke, but with a waiting storm of steel. His death was swift, his keys now yours.

With calculated precision, you turned this trick into a gruesome production line. Rav'ithar, cloaked in the shadow of the fallen guard, became the new gatekeeper. He beckoned another worker, **Heldrick ** , with promises of a secret stash of rum, leading him into the same fatal ambush. Then came the formidable **Stone Guard, Corgrim Smelt-Eye** , a warrior lured to his death by the lie that his subordinates were slacking off inside. He, too, fell to your coordinated assault.

Your quiet butchery was nearly exposed by the arrival of **"Peepers,"** the foundry's all-seeing Scrutinizer. As the construct floated towards the cottage, its alarm ready to sound, you sprung a new trap. A globe of absolute silence enveloped the cottage, swallowing all sound. As the machine entered the unnatural quiet, the very ground erupted in grasping vines, entangling and holding it fast. You descended upon the helpless machine, tearing it apart and ensuring your infiltration remained a secret.

With the ground floor secured, knowledge became your weapon. Rav'ithar, having consumed the researcher Korvun's memories, saw the foundry's inner workings laid bare in his mind. He now understood the layout, the chain of command, and the agonizing secret at the facility's heart: a mighty **Geothermal Elemental** , caged and tormented to power the forges.

Assuming the forms of your victims, you ascended to the mezzanine, a catwalk overlooking the foundry floor. You became ghosts in the machine, your disguises perfect, your purpose lethal. An officious **inspector named Kelzar** was the first to fall, tricked into a secluded stairwell where his authority meant nothing against your blades. His own workers were sent to their deaths moments later, commanded to "assist" his corpse. One by one, you cleared the upper level, tricking and executing the remaining duergar hammerers, your movements a ballet of deception and death. The bodies piled up, hidden away in the dark, as you looted the workshops, claiming valuable crystals and unrefined mithril, the very substance you came for.

Your only wild card came in the form of **Og** , a hulking Quaggoth who approached the guard post seeking a salve for a chemical burn. Bentham, still playing the role of the guard, masterfully deflected the beast's questions, sending him away confused but alive, your cover intact.

And so, we find you now, masters of a silent fortress. The entire sub-level and its overlooking mezzanine are under your control, the bodies of your enemies stuffed into closets and crates. You stand in the heart of the enemy's operation, a mountain of corpses behind you and a wealth of intelligence in your hands. But your path forward is blocked by a colossal, roaring turbine, spinning with deadly speed. Before you lies a choice: do you risk manipulating the complex machinery to grant you passage, or do you dare to unleash the raging, imprisoned elemental and ride the wave of chaos that follows? The foundry is quiet for now, but the silence is yours, and it is waiting to be broken.
