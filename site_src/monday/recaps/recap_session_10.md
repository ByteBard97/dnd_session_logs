# Session 10

---

**When last we left our agents of House T'alzar, victory was yours—but at a cost you had yet to discover.**

The Director's office lay quiet after the battle. Koldar slumped dead behind his desk, while Malexa's body sprawled against the wall, her House Glutthraz stiletto no longer a threat. The alarm bell that had summoned reinforcements was silent now.

You got to work looting their secrets. Zyntra bypassed the petrification trap on Koldar's safe, revealing the scope of the conspiracy: a thousand gold pieces in worker wages, gems set aside as bribes for customs officials, and most disturbing of all, raw Black Mithril shards locked in a lead box.

The coded letter painted a clear picture. Rav'ithar's magic broke the seal, and Clank decoded the cipher to reveal Koldar's own words: *The drow grow impatient. The metal is unstable. The artificer resists...*

*The artificer.* **Valandor.**

You moved up to the workshop floor, searching for answers. The workers' graffiti told its own story: "cursed metal makes the Screamers scream louder." You found the assembly room where these horrors were built, and Grumble loaded cart after cart with materials—four thousand gold worth of mithril, adamantine, and tools.

With the Rod of Opening in hand, you approached the adamantine door. When you pressed it to the lock, a voice whispered the command phrase: *"Uzkul-Darak-Thoon."* The magical barriers collapsed, and the door swung open.

Inside the cell, you found what you'd feared but hoped against.

**Valandor was dead.** The torture had been methodical, professional—Glutthraz work. Beside him lay Spinneret, his mechanical spider, broken but not beyond repair.

Clank worked his magic on the construct, bringing it back to life long enough to play Valandor's final message. Even facing death, your brother had given them nothing. *"Find the surface,"* his voice said. *"Claim what was always ours. Protect our family."*

His message pointed beyond this place—to Cairnhollow Isle and the royal catacombs where the real source of Black Mithril waits. The charts you found confirm it: this foundry was just the beginning. The true prize lies elsewhere.

Haribo preserved Valandor's body with magic. Now you carry not just his remains, but his mission.

**The foundry's leaders are dead, their secrets are yours.** You have evidence of House Glutthraz's treachery, charts to Cairnhollow Isle, fire-resistant suits, and a fortune in materials. Malexa's yacht sits at the dock—fast, but traceable. You could sabotage this place with demolition charges, denying its resources to your enemies.

But time is running short. When expected deliveries don't arrive, Clan Fire-Beard will return in force. The foundry still has defenders who don't know their masters are dead.

Valandor's body lies wrapped in Haribo's preserving magic. His final words echo in the air: *"Find the surface. Claim what was always ours. Protect our family."*
