# House Vaerixas - The Exiled Idealists

<link rel="stylesheet" href="../drow_theme.css">

## Overview

House Vaerixas stands as a unique anomaly in drow politics - former rulers of Vlyn'darastyl now living in exile, distinguished by their devotion to Eilistraee rather than Lolth. Despite their heretical beliefs, they maintained power for generations through sheer strength, tactical brilliance, and the willingness to let other houses practice their faith undisturbed. Their exile came not from military defeat, but from ideological extremism that finally pushed traditional drow society too far.
