# Session 4 {#session-4}

**Recap: The Culling of the Sub-Level**

This session covers the party's continued infiltration of the Cinderfork Foundry's geothermal sub-level, focusing on systematically eliminating the personnel and securing the area.

### Cleaning House in the Cottage

*   **Luring the First Guard:** The party began the session in the Research Cottage. To eliminate the nearby guard, Bentham took the form of the deceased Alyxina Fire-Beard and ran out screaming about a fire. The guard, **Borland Emberback**, was successfully lured inside.
*   **Ambush and Assassination:** The party, hiding in the kitchen, ambushed and quickly killed Borland as he entered. They looted his body, taking his keys and other personal effects.
*   **A Chain of Deception:** The party decided to systematically lure the remaining personnel on the level into their trap.
    *   Rav'ithar, using his Whispers Bard ability, took on the shadow of the dead guard, Borland, and stood watch outside.
    *   He encountered another worker, **Heldrick Stonebrow**, and convinced him that "Alyxina" had a special new rum for him inside the cottage. Heldrick was lured in and killed by the party.
    *   Next, a tougher **Stone Guard** named **Corgrim Smelt-Eye** approached. Rav'ithar (as Borland) complained that Heldrick was slacking off and drinking inside the cottage, convincing Corgrim to go in and retrieve him. Corgrim was also ambushed and killed.

### Silencing the Alarm

*   **Encounter with "Peepers":** The floating **Scrutinizer** construct ("Peepers") approached the cottage, noticing the empty guard post and calling for the guards.
*   **Containment and Destruction:** To prevent an alarm, Rav'ithar cast *Silence* over the area. Haribo followed up by casting *Entangle*, successfully restraining the construct. The party then moved in and destroyed Peepers, with Clank salvaging some of its mechanical parts. With this final kill, the immediate area around the cottage was secured.

### Knowledge and Ascension

*   **The Researcher's Knowledge:** Rav'ithar, having absorbed the memories of Chief Researcher Korvun, gained a detailed understanding of the geothermal plant's layout, including the chief engineer's location, the function of the machinery, and the nature of the **Bound Geothermal Elemental** held in the steam chamber.
*   **Clearing the Mezzanine:** With the lower level temporarily secured, the party decided to move up to the mezzanine overlooking the factory floor. Rav'ithar assumed the form of Korvun, Malagar took the form of the dead Stone Guard Corgrim, and Clank disguised himself as a generic duergar worker. Bentham remained below, disguised as the guard Borland.
*   **Systematic Elimination:** The party methodically cleared the mezzanine level.
    *   They first encountered an officious inspector named **Kelzar**. Rav'ithar (as Korvun) intimidated the inspector and lured him into a stairwell, where the party ambushed and killed him.
    *   Rav'ithar then commanded the two duergar workers on the main mezzanine to go "help the inspector," leading them into the same stairwell ambush.
    *   They moved to the containment array room, tricking the **Duergar Hammerer** inside to come out, where he was also slain.
    *   They finished by killing a final Hammerer in an ore-processing room.
*   **Loot and Intel:** The party looted the mezzanine, acquiring valuable **focusing crystals**, a significant amount of **unrefined mithril ore**, and a **Ledger of Test Batches** that provided insight into the DÃ»mril alloying process.

### An Unlikely Visitor

*   **Og the Quaggoth:** While the main party was upstairs, Bentham (in Borland's form) was approached at the guard post by **Og**, a large Quaggoth. Og was suffering from a chemical burn caused by coolant and was looking for a specific salve. Bentham successfully deceived Og, convincing him that the researchers were out. Og left, disappointed but unsuspecting.

### Session Conclusion

The session ended with the party having successfully and silently cleared the entire sub-level and the mezzanine of all personnel, accumulating a small mountain of bodies in the Research Cottage's storage room. They now have a secure base of operations within the foundry. They know they must pass through a massive, high-speed turbine to proceed, and are contemplating their next move, which involves either disabling the turbine or dealing with the powerful, enraged Geothermal Elemental.
