*Weapon (lance), rare*

**Weapon Type.** Lance (martial melee weapon, PHB rules).
**Properties.** Reach, special (disadvantage when attacking a target within 5 ft.; two-handed when not mounted).

**Melee Attack â€” Piercing Strike.**

* Damage: **1d12 piercing**
* **Enlarged Strike.** If you are a duergar or under the effect of *Enlarge*, damage becomes **2d12 piercing**.

### **Flame Jet (Requires Fuel)**

As an action, expend **1 fuel charge** to unleash fire in one of two patterns:

* **Cone:** 15-foot cone
* **Line:** 30-foot line, 5 feet wide

Each creature in the area must make a **DC 12 Dexterity saving throw**, taking **3d6 fire damage** on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

**Overpressure.** After using Flame Jet, roll a d6. On a 1, the lance overheats and cannot use Flame Jet again for one minute.

**Fuel Requirement.** The Fire Lance requires **Alchemical Fire Canisters**. Without fuel, it functions only as a mundane lance. Refueling the fire lance takes an action to install the fuel pack.
