# Session 9

**Epic Path Reminders**

* **Ariasia ("Ari"), The Lost One:**  
  You've learned that the key to finding your way home lies in the **lost treasure of the Dragonlords**. Pythor hinted that the undead captain Estor Arkelander—haunting the legendary ship Ultros—last possessed this treasure. To move forward, you must eventually seek out the Ultros and confront Estor's ghost. For now, the city's troubles and the stolen Horn of Balmytria stand in the way, but keep an ear open for anything that might lead you to that ghostly vessel.  
* **Demetrius, The Vanished One:**  
  You recovered the Crown of the Dragonlords, but **Gaius of the Order of Sydon** has stolen your famed armor. He's reportedly fortified himself on an island in the Cerulean Sea, well-guarded and loyal to the Titan Sydon. To fully reclaim your legacy, you'll need to retrieve your armor from Gaius. But first, you must survive your current obligations in Estoria, including the grim deal made with Gaius over Princess Anora's sacrifice.  
* **Kain, The Dragonslayer:**  
  Destiny calls you to become the bane of evil dragons. To forge a weapon worthy of such a task, you must speak with the **Forgekeeper in the Mithral Mines**. That journey awaits once you've dealt with the pressing threats in Estoria and reclaimed the Horn of Balmytria. Keep watch for clues that lead to the hidden Mithral Forge and the tools you'll need to face monstrous foes like Hexia.  
* **Kalian, The Gifted One:**  
  Your grandmother's spirit and the Oracle Versi guide you towards resurrecting the glory of the Dragonlords and exacting vengeance on Sydon. Before you can do that, you must retrieve the stolen **Horn of Balmytria**, now lost somewhere in the Oldwoods. Aesop has cleansed you of the curse of the graverobber in exchange for your oath to return with the Horn. Finding it in the Mossy Temple, where the fey Demetria and her goatlings lurk, is now your immediate concern.  
* **Tharok, The Cursed One:**  
  Damon, the guardian of the Necropolis, directed you to **Scorpion Island** to seek the Lotus Witch, who may hold the key to ending your curse. While that journey lies ahead, the path is dangerous and your party's immediate predicament in Estoria demands attention first. Remember that the answers you seek are out there, beyond the city's walls, once your current duties are done.  
* **Zephyrion, The Demi-god:**  
  You've met your father, Pythor, who revealed that the green dragon Hexia stole your mother away. Before you can undertake that rescue and claim your divine legacy, you must help resolve the crisis in Estoria. You've agreed to take Princess Anora's place in the sacrifice at the Rock of Estor. Surviving that deadly bargain will reaffirm your worthiness and strengthen the bond with your father, who holds the key to forging your destiny as the next God of Battle.

**Party-Wide Quests**

* **The Great Labors:**  
  * **Claim the Weapons of the Dragonlords:** You've found relics like the Axe of Xander, Shield of Volkan, and Breastplate of Mytros, but they remain damaged or incomplete. They must be restored at the **Mithral Forge**, once you have Pythor's Hammer.  
  * **Light the Mithral Forge:** The Forge awaits your rekindling so that Volkan can reforge your legendary arms and armor. This will be critical before facing greater threats.  
  * **Drink from the Horn of Balmytria:** Now that we have recovered the horn we must drink from it.  
* **The Sacrifice at the Rock of Estor:**  
  In a desperate gamble to save Princess Anora, you've struck a deal to sacrifice yourselves in her stead. The full moon looms only five days away. You must decide how to survive this ordeal—whether by outwitting your foes, preparing clever defenses, or finding a way to break this dark bargain without dooming the city.
