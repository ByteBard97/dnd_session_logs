Log

* **Xander's Revelation**  
  * In the hallowed halls of the Necropolis, the mighty Dragonlord **Xander Huorath** imparts a dire message to **Demetrius**:  
    * **Sydon's Chief Military Leader, Gaius**, has **stolen Demetrius' legendary armor**.  
    * Gaius, a formidable warrior and one of **Sydon's most ruthless servants**, has hidden the armor on his **fortified island** in the **Cerulean Sea**.  
* **A New Ally Arrives**  
  * As the party prepares to leave the tomb of Xander, a new figure emerges from the shadows:  
    * **Kalian, "The Gifted One"**, sent by the enigmatic **Oracle Versi** to replace their fallen wizard companion.  
    * The party entrusts **Kalian** with the **crown of the Dragonlords**, a pivotal artifact tied to his destiny. **Ari** watches in bewildered astonishment, wondering about this unexpected exchange.

    * After a fierce battle, they triumph over the amorphous threat, securing an **adamantium breastplate and shield**.  
    * However, the black pudding's corrosive **acid** wreaks havoc, **damaging Zephyrion's mail armor** and other gear.  
* **Exploring the Necropolis**  
  * In **Tomb \#5**, the party finds no body, heightening the mystery surrounding these sacred grounds.  
  * **Tomb \#6** reveals a treasure trove:  
    * By carefully **pulling off the lid**, they uncover a **mythril breastplate, a kopis, and a mythril shield**.  
    * **Kalian** inadvertently triggers the **curse of the graverobber** without touching the items, adding a layer of peril to their haul.  
* **Journey Back to Estoria**  
  * Deciding to leave the Necropolis, the party makes their way back to **Estoria**:

* **Visiting Volkan's Hall**  
  * Back in the city, the heroes head to **Volkan's Hall**:  
    * **Zephyrion** presents his **damaged armor** to **Volkan**, who agrees to repair it in **two days** for **10 gp**.  
    * **Volkan** reveals that to **repair their items**, they need **Pythor's Hammer** and the **Mythril Forge**.

  * Inside the grand yet gloomy **Estorian Palace**, the party finds **King Pythor** in a state of drunken despair:  
    * **Aunty Kyrah**, **Goddess of Music** and sister to Pythor, scolds him for his **self-pitying excesses**.  
    * **Zephyrion** steps forward, engaging in a heartfelt conversation with **Pythor**:  
      * A poignant **father-son moment** unfolds as **Pythor** shares the tragic tale of **Zephyrion's mother**, who was **stolen by the fearsome dragon Hexia** and taken to a distant **island**.  
* **Confronting Gaius**  
  * **Gaius**, the arrogant leader of the **Order of Sydon**, confronts the party within the palace:  
    * He demands the **sacrifice of Princess Anora** to **Sydon**, seeking to **humiliate King Pythor**.  
    * Through **diplomacy and clever negotiation**, the party persuades **Gaius** to allow them to **take Anora's place** as the sacrifice at the **Rock of Estor** during the next full moon, agreeing to be **chained and disarmed**.  
* **Ari's Destiny Unveiled**  
  * **Ariasia** inquires about her **Epic Path**, and **Pythor** reveals:

* **Clues in the Wilderness**  
  * **Kain** discovers **small hoof prints** stained with **magical wine**, identifying the mischief-makers as **goatlings**â€”**mischievous and sometimes evil fey** resembling small satyrs.  
  * The trail leads **south of Estoria** into the **forests**, pointing towards the **Mossy Temple**, the ominous abode of **Demetria**, the **fey Sister of Versi**.  
* **Preparing for the Full Moon Sacrifice**
