# Session 27

The session picked up directly after the party's success in the sewers.

1. **Tharok's Sewer Plague & Temple Visit:**  
   * Tharok had contracted Sewer Plague.  
   * The party discussed obtaining a Lesser Restoration spell.  
   * They decided to go to the Temple of the Five Gods, knowing that common temple services, including Lesser and Greater Restoration, are offered for free.  
   * At the temple, a high priest immediately tended to Tharok's affliction, performing a ritual that purified him, expelling "black dust" from his body.  
   * The temple also offered them the use of their ritual baths and scented oils, which Tharok accepted.  
   * They inquired about the cost of Death Ward (a 4th level spell) for future reference, learning it would be 320 gold for a scroll.  
   * It was clarified that Divine Soul Sorcerers (like Rhy-At) can pick cleric spells, making them potential users of cleric spell scrolls.  
2. **Audience with Queen Vallus and Royal Rewards:**  
   * The party made their way to the Queen's palace.  
   * They were met by Mikaera, the chief attendant, who informed them they arrived at "just the right time".  
   * Queen Vallus was chastising and "dressing down" Trellus and Septia, the Lutherian cult members from the sketchy bar who smuggled children.  
   * Tharok showed his disdain by mean-mugging and spitting at their feet as they were dragged away in chains.  
   * Queen Vallus acknowledged their courage in rescuing the children and preventing the catastrophe in the sewers, noting their fame was growing.  
   * She offered them a choice of  
      **two** items from the royal vaults as a reward, acknowledging their accomplishments.  
   * After some persuasion (a successful roll of 29 with advantage and guidance from Rhy-At and Andrew Lynx, thanks to Nikandros's compelling case about Oracle's chosen heroes), the Queen agreed to grant them  
      **two** items instead of one.  
   * The party discussed the options: Spell Needle, Titan's Fury Bow, Wand of Switch Step, Sending Stones, Master Guide, Tome of Harmonious Thought, and Robe of the Weave .  
     * The  
        **Robe of the Weave** was described as an "insane item". It gives \+2 AC, \+1 spell save DC, \+1 spell attack rolls, and 1d6 hit points on successful saving throws against spells. It requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard.  
     * The  
        **Wand of Switch Step** allows for instantaneous position exchange of allies/enemies. It has 1d4 charges, regains 1d4 at dawn, and has a 1 in 20 chance to vanish if all charges are expended.  
     * The  
        **Tome of Harmonious Thought** gives \+1 to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma (permanently, once per 100 years per person).  
   * They initially chose the Robe of the Weave and the Wand of Switch Step. Nikandros expressed interest in the Robe of the Weave due to its healing on saving throws. The party decided the Wand of Switch Step would be good for Nikandros due to its action cost and battlefield control.  
   * The Queen also subtly warned them not to bring the  
      *Ultros* (the ancestor's ship) back to her husband, King Acastus, as he has other plans and is trying to use them. Andrew Lynx knew Astor Archelander (King Acastus's ancestor) was a bloodthirsty dragon lord.  
3. **Hero's Feast and Shopping Spree:**  
   * The party decided to take a long rest and eat dinner at the palace, which granted them the benefits of a Hero's Feast.  
   * The Hero's Feast cured diseases (like Tharok's sewer plague), granted immunity to poison and frightened conditions for 24 hours, advantage on Wisdom saving throws, and an increase in hit point maximum by 2d10 (Tharok rolled 15 extra HP).  
   * After the feast, they went to the dive bar (Satyrs' Tail) where Tharok had previously arm-wrestled.  
   * Tharok bought drinks for everyone (20 gold).  
   * Zephyrion flirted with the satyr-human hybrid barmaid, Lyra.  
   * Tharok challenged the minotaur (whom he previously defeated) to a drinking contest. The minotaur was "cowed" and agreed to a friendly wager of 5 gold pieces.  
   * Nikandros played his harp (borrowing Tharok's magical instrument) and conjured squirrels to re-enact their sewer fight, impressing the crowd and earning 50 gold pieces.  
   * Kain (the spy) met with his contact, Sari the Knight, at the bar. Sari provided three rumors for 50 gold pieces each (total 150 gp):  
     * Queen Thessalia wears a full helm because no one may look on her divine beauty.  
     * A hidden bay on the east coast of the Isle of Themis is choked with rocks, but an underwater tunnel leads to it.  
     * The Amazons have mutated and trained a giant hydra to guard their underground lair, devouring anyone who enters.  
   * They then went to Talia's shop for supplies.  
   * Tharok signed a potion for Talia as an "endorsement".  
   * They tried to sell monster parts (cobold eggs, maw teeth). Tharok gave two kobold eggs to Vulcan and Pyra as gifts for future apprentices, keeping one for himself.  
   * They purchased:  
     * Two **Superior Healing Potions** for each of the 6 party members (12 total), at a discounted price due to Talia's appreciation for their fame. Initial price 330 gp each, total 3960 gp.  
     * **Elixirs of Health** (300 gp each, cures diseases/conditions). They bought two, making the total spend 3960 \+ 600 \= 4560 gp.  
     * One  
        **Oil of Sharpness** (320 gp).  
     * Five  
        **Potions of Heroism** (one for each except Tharok).  
   * They sold various items:  
     * Silver ring (Coil of the Eternal Serpent) for 100 gold. This ring provides 1d6 poison damage on piercing/slashing attacks, advantage on saves vs. poison, a bonus action to coat weapon for 2d6 extra damage on next hit (once per short rest), and allows speaking with snakes/serpentine creatures. It requires attunement.  
     * Fine jade figurine for 275 gold (negotiated up from 200).  
     * Finely crafted music box for 250 gold. It casts Soothing Lullaby (Calm Emotions) once per day.  
     * Six Hematite Spheres for 900 gold (150 each).  
     * Mithril Short Sword \+1 and Scale Mail Armor with serpent. These were likely sold, though specific prices aren't immediately clear from the transcript.  
   * They opted to keep the  
      **Scarab of Protection** in party loot (provides \+1 to all saves, advantage on saves vs. spells, 12 charges to force succeed on necromancy/undead effects).  
4. **Travel to the Mithril Forge and New Revelations:**  
   * The party decided to go directly to the Mithril Forge, delaying the  
      *Ultros* quest.  
   * They chose to travel on  
      **The Swift Dawn** with Captain Ione Stormwind for 225 gold (negotiated down from 240, after initially being 120 and then 240 to increase speed). Nikandros playing his harp allowed them to get 7 mph speed.  
   * The travel took 4 hours.  
   * They arrived at the Mithril Forge around 2 PM.  
   * Mage Hand was used to pull the lever and open the waterfall entrance.  
   * At the forge, Pyra and Vulcan had been doing remodeling.  
   * Pyra presented them with the  
      **Cloak of Magic Immunity** as their first commission. This cloak allows the wearer to spend charges (equal to spell's level) as a reaction to become immune to a spell's effects, regaining all charges daily.  
   * Vulcan revealed a  
      **Calydonian** , a messenger construct from the old days, found during clearing ruins.  
   * To repair the Calydonian, Vulcan needs two Mithril ingots and 1000 gold pieces.  
   * The party immediately provided the Mithril (from a Mithril-inlaid axe and other Mithril items) and the 1000 gold pieces. Once repaired (in 3 days), the Calydonian can deliver commissioned items and collected materials directly to the party anywhere, saving travel time.  
   * Vulcan also presented Tharok with a  
      **Baby Basilisk companion** (named "Baby Bjorn" or "Bjorn" after Tharok's axe), which will grow over time with feeding and care. It's a small creature that starts with a PB of 2\.  
   * Tharok also decided to give two of his kobold eggs to Vulcan and Pyra as gifts, for them to raise as apprentices. He kept one for himself.  
   * The Wyvern egg they possess is expected to hatch in about 5 days.

 **Current Status of the Party:**

* Healed from Sewer Plague.  
* Received two powerful magic items: Robe of the Weave (Nikandros) and Wand of Switch Step.  
* Received the Cloak of Magic Immunity.  
* Commissioned the repair of the Calydonian messenger construct, providing the materials.  
* Tharok has a new baby basilisk companion (Baby Bjorn).  
* They are well-stocked with healing potions, elixirs of health, and potions of heroism.  
* They are currently at the Mithril Forge.  
* Their next major decision is whether to immediately pursue the  
   *Ultros* (as Queen Vallus secretly instructed) or return to Sour Vintage for more rumors (as she publicly suggested) before going for the ship.. The Wyvern egg is due to hatch soon
