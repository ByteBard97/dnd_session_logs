# Session 8

**Epic Path Reminders**

* **Ariasia ("Ari"), The Lost One:**  
  You've learned that the key to finding your way home lies in the **lost treasure of the Dragonlords**. Pythor hinted that the undead captain Estor Arkelander—haunting the legendary ship Ultros—last possessed this treasure. To move forward, you must eventually seek out the Ultros and confront Estor's ghost. For now, the city's troubles and the stolen Horn of Balmytria stand in the way, but keep an ear open for anything that might lead you to that ghostly vessel.  
* **Demetrius, The Vanished One:**  
  You recovered the Crown of the Dragonlords, but **Gaius of the Order of Sydon** has stolen your famed armor. He's reportedly fortified himself on an island in the Cerulean Sea, well-guarded and loyal to the Titan Sydon. To fully reclaim your legacy, you'll need to retrieve your armor from Gaius. But first, you must survive your current obligations in Estoria, including the grim deal made with Gaius over Princess Anora's sacrifice.  
* **Kain, The Dragonslayer:**  
  Destiny calls you to become the bane of evil dragons. To forge a weapon worthy of such a task, you must speak with the **Forgekeeper in the Mithral Mines**. That journey awaits once you've dealt with the pressing threats in Estoria and reclaimed the Horn of Balmytria. Keep watch for clues that lead to the hidden Mithral Forge and the tools you'll need to face monstrous foes like Hexia.  
* **Kalian, The Gifted One:**  
  Your grandmother's spirit and the Oracle Versi guide you towards resurrecting the glory of the Dragonlords and exacting vengeance on Sydon. Before you can do that, you must retrieve the stolen **Horn of Balmytria**, now lost somewhere in the Oldwoods. Aesop has cleansed you of the curse of the graverobber in exchange for your oath to return with the Horn. Finding it in the Mossy Temple, where the fey Demetria and her goatlings lurk, is now your immediate concern.  
* **Tharok, The Cursed One:**  
  Damon, the guardian of the Necropolis, directed you to **Scorpion Island** to seek the Lotus Witch, who may hold the key to ending your curse. While that journey lies ahead, the path is dangerous and your party's immediate predicament in Estoria demands attention first. Remember that the answers you seek are out there, beyond the city's walls, once your current duties are done.  
* **Zephyrion, The Demi-god:**  
  You've met your father, Pythor, who revealed that the green dragon Hexia stole your mother away. Before you can undertake that rescue and claim your divine legacy, you must help resolve the crisis in Estoria. You've agreed to take Princess Anora's place in the sacrifice at the Rock of Estor. Surviving that deadly bargain will reaffirm your worthiness and strengthen the bond with your father, who holds the key to forging your destiny as the next God of Battle.

**Party-Wide Quests**

* **The Great Labors:**  
  * **Claim the Weapons of the Dragonlords:** You've found relics like the Axe of Xander, Shield of Volkan, and Breastplate of Mytros, but they remain damaged or incomplete. They must be restored at the **Mithral Forge**, once you have Pythor's Hammer.  
  * **Light the Mithral Forge:** The Forge awaits your rekindling so that Volkan can reforge your legendary arms and armor. This will be critical before facing greater threats.  
  * **Drink from the Horn of Balmytria:** The Horn that once rested in Estoria's Dragon Shrine has been stolen. You must recover it from the goatlings and Demetria in the Mossy Temple if you hope to complete this ritual of guidance and power.  
* **The Sacrifice at the Rock of Estor:**  
  In a desperate gamble to save Princess Anora, you've struck a deal to sacrifice yourselves in her stead. The full moon looms only five days away. You must decide how to survive this ordeal—whether by outwitting your foes, preparing clever defenses, or finding a way to break this dark bargain without dooming the city.  
* **Recovering the Horn of Balmytria:**  
  Without this relic, many blessings and rituals remain beyond your grasp. Its theft has forced a confrontation with the fey and their mistress, Demetria. Before you sail off to new islands or venture deeper into cursed caverns, you must restore the Horn to Estoria's shrine and fulfill your oaths.  
  **Log**   
  **The Forest's Whispers**  
* The dense, ancient trees of the Oldwood loomed around you as Corinna led the way, her tear-streaked face filled with desperation. She spoke of children trapped within the Mossy Temple, ensnared by Demetria's wicked enchantments.  
* Zephyrion's decisive, though impulsive, blow against a goatling sent a clear message—your party was not here for games. You were here to save lives.  
  **Secrets in the Shadows**  
* At the standing stones, the peculiar squirrel revealed itself.. Kain's magic brought communication, and Tharok's charisma earned the creature's trust, but Herkus's riddled words hinted at deeper horrors within the temple.  
* At last, the temple itself came into view, its towering marble pillars tangled with massive roots and coated in moss, as though nature itself sought to reclaim this cursed place.  
  **Trials in the Temple**  
* Battling through animate roots that sought to halt your progress, you pressed forward. Your clever use of stealth, spells, and teamwork saw you past the treacherous pool of swirling shapes, with Kalian's magic saving Zephyrion from the waters' ominous grasp.  
* The statues of Sydon demanded offerings. Coins and murmured prayers allowed safe passage, though the bitter taste of appeasement lingered as you descended deeper into the temple's heart.  
  **The Glade's Warnings**  
* In the ancient glade, you found a tormented boy, Sostrate, harried by cruel goatlings. Arrows flew, blades flashed, and Demetrius's mocking words seared their twisted hearts. Sostrate's rescue was swift and decisive, and Corinna's reunion with her friend brought a spark of hope amidst the gloom.  
* Strange plants revived your spirits, and a meeting with Melenthe, the friendly dryad, gifted you magical wine and dire warnings of Demetria's fall from grace. Even the fey were wary of the vengeful dryad's growing power.  
  **A Sinister Banquet**  
* You stumbled upon teenagers in a pink fungus-laden cavern, their minds dulled by enchanted bread, wine, and cheese. Zephyrion's sharp discipline broke their stupor, and together with Corinna, you convinced them to flee the temple's grasp.  
* The horrors of Demetria's domain deepened when you discovered goatlings cooking sinister meat in the kitchen—dead children, victims of the dryad's dark rituals. The revulsion strengthened your resolve.  
  **A Final Confrontation**  
* At last, you entered Demetria's chambers. Her ritual was in full swing, with four teenage girls seated at a cursed feast. The plates held food that could transform them into monstrous maenads. With split-second decisions, Kain cast entangle, trapping Demetria, her gygan companion, and two of the girls.  
* Ari rushed forward, scattering the plates to save the innocent. Tharok and Zephyrion launched ferocious attacks, felling the gygan with heroic blows. Meanwhile, Kalian unleashed radiant magic, and Demetrius's vicious whispers unraveled Demetria's composure.  
* Facing the might of your combined strength, Demetria surrendered, offering a potion to reverse the maenads' transformation and swearing to change her ways. Her hatred for Estor Arkelander burned deep, and Ari shared her vow to one day slay the dragonlord who had wronged them both.  
  **Victory and Questions**  
* The Horn of Balmytria is yours\! Its legendary power awaits, but so too does the question of Demetria's fate. Will you trust her promises of reform or take a harder path? Corinna and her rescued friends offer gratitude and speak of rewards waiting at her father's vineyard in Estoria.  
* Ahead lies the Mithral Forge, brimming with ancient potential, but the shadow of the full moon and the looming threat of Estor's Rock cast a dark pall over your triumphs.
