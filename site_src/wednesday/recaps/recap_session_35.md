## Session 35 Quest Log: Into the Heart of Fire

### Into the Volcanic Fortress

Following our infiltration through the secret entrance, we pressed deeper into the Firewalker stronghold. The volcanic tunnels revealed chambers lined with **strange red crystals**, pulsing with light and resonating like a haunting song. The crystals seemed to stir in time with the very breathing of the mountain.

Despite Xatli’s cautions that disturbing them might bring danger, we gathered a number of the crystals. When set into the **Horde Maul**, the weapon glowed red-hot, radiating a dangerous new power.

### Blood in the Shadows

Our stealth advance continued with ruthless efficiency. **Kain** dropped a sentry with a single arrow before he could cry out, his body falling silently into the lava below. A second guard was drawn close by **Rhy-At’s disguise**, only to be ambushed and cut down. When **Andrew Lynx** struck with the empowered Maul, the blow ignited the foe in strange crystal fire.

### Carrion Crawler Ambush

In exploring the tunnels, **Kain** stumbled into a nest of carrion crawlers. The grotesque creatures lunged from the shadows but were quickly dispatched. **Xatli** pinned one to the wall with her spear, and Kain harvested venom from the remains.

### Current Position

With patrols silenced and Xatli leading us on, we have gained a foothold in the volcanic fortress. The Firewalkers remain unaware of our presence — for now. Strange chanting echoes deeper in the tunnels, a sign of dangers yet to come.
