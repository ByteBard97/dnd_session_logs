## Session 35 Quest Log: Into the Heart of Fire

### Into the Volcanic Fortress

Following our infiltration through the secret entrance, we pressed deeper into the Firewalker stronghold. The volcanic tunnels revealed chambers lined with **strange red crystals**, pulsing with light and resonating like a haunting song. The crystals seemed to stir in time with the very breathing of the mountain.

Despite Xatli’s cautions that disturbing them might bring danger, we gathered a number of the crystals. When set into the **Horde Maul**, the weapon glowed red-hot, radiating a dangerous new power.

### Blood in the Shadows

Our stealth advance continued with ruthless efficiency. **Kain** dropped a sentry with a single arrow before he could cry out, his body falling silently into the lava below. A second guard was drawn close by **Rhy-At’s disguise**, only to be ambushed and cut down. When **Andrew Lynx** struck with the empowered Maul, the blow ignited the foe in strange crystal fire.

### Carrion Crawler Ambush

In exploring the tunnels, **Kain** stumbled into a nest of carrion crawlers. The grotesque creatures lunged from the shadows but were quickly dispatched. **Xatli** pinned one to the wall with her spear, and Kain harvested venom from the remains.

### Current Position

With patrols silenced and Xatli leading us on, we have gained a foothold in the volcanic fortress. The Firewalkers remain unaware of our presence — for now. Strange chanting echoes deeper in the tunnels, a sign of dangers yet to come.

## Opening Recap for Next Session

\*"Last we left our heroes, you stood in the shadows of the Firewalker fortress, deep in the volcanic tunnels of Fire Island. Blood still dripped where Kain’s arrows had sent guards tumbling into magma. The Horde Maul glowed with searing heat, supercharged by the mysterious red crystals you pried from the living rock.

Behind you lay the corpses of carrion crawlers, their paralytic venom now bottled and ready. At your side, Xatli gripped her obsidian spear, her earlier warnings echoing as the mountain itself seemed to breathe around you.

And ahead — faint, rhythmic chanting carried through the stone. The element of surprise is yours… but for how long?"\*
