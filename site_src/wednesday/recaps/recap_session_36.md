# **Session 36: The Three-Eyed God**

When last we left our heroes, you had pushed deep into the fiery heart of the Firewalker fortress. Following the faint sounds of chanting, you found yourselves outside a large chamber built from the shell of a colossal dragon turtle. Inside, a Lizard Queen and her shaman were performing a ritual before a three-eyed statue of the titan Sydon.

Your assault was swift and decisive. Kain, you blanketed the chamber in a thick fog, sowing chaos and fear among your enemies. Nikandros, you empowered your allies, granting supernatural speed to Zephyrion and Tharok. The hasted warriors charged blindly into the mist, guided only by the sounds of their foes.

Zephyrion, you were the first to feel the statue's wrath as a bolt of lightning seared you, but you pushed through, your trident finding and silencing the life of the wounded shaman. Tharok, you followed, absorbing a second lightning blast with your enchanted axe before striking back, gouging a great chunk from the stone idol and dimming its magical light. As the fog cleared at your command, the scene was revealed: the shaman lay dead, and the panicked guards were attempting to drag their hysterical queen to safety. Kain, your aim was true; a single, powerful arrow shattered the statue’s brow, dislodging one of its emerald eyes and breaking the will of your opponents.

The Lizard Queen surrendered. From your new captive, you learned critical intelligence: one of the coveted brass dragon eggs has hatched, and the wyrmling is now the pet of King Jankor himself. A second egg lies in a salamander’s nest nearby, and the fire snake eggs you seek are kept in a separate chamber to the northwest. She also spoke of a captive smith, a rare cyclops named Steros, who toils in the southwest of the fortress.

Unwilling to execute a surrendered foe, you took the queen and her guards as hostages. Zephyrion, you bound the queen to your back while Tharok led her guards on ropes. Your advance toward the throne room was a brutal spectacle of efficiency. Patrols were systematically and silently eliminated—pushed from high ledges by Kain, kicked into the magma by Tharok, and grappled and thrown from a bridge by Zephyrion.

But your final, violent act did not go unnoticed. A salamander guard witnessed the execution and screamed an alarm, alerting the entire throne room to your presence. There, you saw him: King Jankor, seated on his throne, his dragon wyrmling hopping excitedly at his feet. You presented his captured queen, a threat you believed would end the conflict. But his fanaticism was absolute. "Sydon must come first\!" he roared, scorning his own queen's life.

And that is where we find ourselves. The king’s defiance echoes in the cavern. The bodies of his guards smolder in the lava below. His pet dragon hisses, and his hand tightens around a powerful, lightning-wreathed staff. The battle you came for is here.

What do you do?
