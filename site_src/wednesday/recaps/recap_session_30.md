# Session 30 Recap: Thrice Defeated
**07/16/2025**

Heroes of the Prophecy\! Your battle for the soul of the *Ultros* had just begun. In the quiet aftermath of your clash with the first mate Skaethon, you took stock of your spoils—the magical armor **Azurescale**, the bite-marked sword **Ebony**, and a collection of strange, powerful potions. With the captain’s challenge still ringing in your ears, you chose not to be his pawns. Instead, you forged your own path.

You sought out the remaining "traitorous" thanes, not as assassins, but as allies. First, you found **Metron, the Navigator**, who agreed to help you overthrow the tyrannical Captain Estor. His price: a promise to free the spectral crew from their 500-year servitude and to safeguard an ornate, magically sealed box that pulsed with contained spirits. Next, you confronted **Davos, the Quartermaster**, on the top deck. He too pledged his support, promising to keep the spectral rowers from joining the fray, so long as you secured the aid of his fellow thanes. Between these tense negotiations, Kain communed with **Delphia**, the dryad spirit of the ship, who whispered a cryptic warning: "He must be defeated thrice."

With new alliances forged, you prepared for the final confrontation. Zephyrion and Tharok, chugging powerful potions, swelled to immense, ship-rocking proportions, while Andrew Lynx shrank to a fraction of his size. As you approached **Estor Arkelander** on his throne, he hurled a vicious taunt at Kyra, igniting her fury and the battle. Estor’s initial spells were snuffed out by a rapid series of counterspells from Rhy-At and Andrew, leaving him open. Empowered by Haste, the giant forms of Zephyrion and Tharok unleashed a devastating onslaught, grievously wounding the ghost captain. In a desperate act of retaliation, Estor cast a wave of terror, causing Tharok to drop his axe and flee. But it was not enough. A final, searing Eldritch Blast from Andrew Lynx struck true, and Estor’s form dissolved into ash.

But as Delphia had warned, the fight was not over. A purple meteor streaked from the heavens, slamming into the deck and erupting in a blast of psychic fire. From the crater rose a **Giant Skeleton** wreathed in psychic energy—Estor’s second form. The battle raged anew. Kyra, incandescent with rage, unleashed a powerful lightning bolt from her wand, but in a flash, it was absorbed by Tharok’s axe, supercharging the weapon with crackling energy. Now recovered from his fear, Tharok landed a thunderous blow, discharging the stored lightning and dealing immense damage. Zephyrion followed with a flurry of his own, and the skeletal form was shattered.

As the bones crumbled, the air grew deathly cold. Frost crept across the decks as a blood-red moon rose with unnatural speed. A crimson beam shone down, and from it, Estor’s final, **Ghostly Apparition** emerged. This was his most dangerous form. After weathering another onslaught, the ghost vanished and reappeared inside Tharok, possessing him. Kyra screamed a warning, and you were faced with a terrible choice. Focusing your attacks on your enthralled friend, you managed to knock him unconscious, forcing Estor’s spirit out. Exposed once more, the ghost captain was quickly overwhelmed. Wielding a flaming kopis, Zephyrion stabbed the apparition again and again, finally destroying the tyrant of the *Ultros* for good.

With Estor truly defeated, the spirit of Delphia was freed. She floated from the mast and, with a gentle kiss, breathed life back into the fallen Tharok. You now have control of the legendary ghost ship. A new captain must be chosen, and a decision made about the spectral crew.
