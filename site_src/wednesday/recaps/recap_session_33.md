# Session 33: The Bloodscale Banquet

***

The taste of victory over the Firewalker ambush was still fresh as you were led through the sweltering jungle, the air thick with the tang of volcanic ash. You arrived at the Bloodscale village, a collection of reed-thatched huts clinging to the edge of a slow-moving river, where life and ritual moved in equal measure. Your attention was quickly drawn to two things: a crude bamboo cage holding sullen Firewalker prisoners, and a strange, sacred cauldron bubbling with iridescent, hallucinogenic vapor.

While some of you interrogated the captive leader, Kretz—who spun a web of obvious lies about the weakness of his fortress and king—Tharok was drawn to the cauldron. Inhaling deeply, his mind was thrown into a powerful vision. He saw a colossal black serpent coiled around the volcano and was met by a beautiful woman of pure flame, the goddess Chalcia, who bestowed a cryptic kiss upon his cheek.

You were brought before the tribe’s leader, the commanding Queen Vytha. To seal your new alliance, she announced a great honor: a sacred feast. You were to be the honored guests, and the centerpiece of the meal was to be her own son, Prince Skrill, who stepped forward willingly to be sacrificed for your strength.

Faced with this grisly honor, you hesitated. In a moment of quick thinking, Andrew Lynx created a diversion, firing a blast of arcane energy into the jungle to fake an attack. The ruse worked perfectly. The feast was postponed, and you feigned a pursuit of the non-existent enemies into the wilderness.

Once alone, you debated the shocking tradition. It was Rhy-At, looking to the stars and the alignment of the heavens with his strange instruments, who uncovered the truth. This was no mere cannibalism; it was a powerful ritual. To consume the prince's flesh was to harmonize your very being with the fundamental forces of creation. With this knowledge, you returned to the village, ready to accept the queen’s offer.

The ceremony resumed under the moonlight. As the drums beat, Prince Skrill was led atop the stone ziggurat. In a moment of divine subversion, Rhy-At secretly consecrated the tribe’s ceremonial dagger to the Five Gods before handing it to the shaman, who then plunged the blade into the prince’s heart.

At the solemn feast that followed, you each made your choice.
* Kain, Tharok, and Rhy-At partook of the sacred meal.
* Andrew Lynx and Nikandros, citing otherworldly and moral reasons, refused the offering.
* Both Bubbles and Bjorn were fed portions, and you watched as they grew subtly larger and more powerful before your eyes.

For those of you who accepted the sacrifice, a new, unshakable power now hums beneath your skin. You feel stronger than you have ever been, your movements quicker and more certain, your thoughts clearer. Tharok feels as though the prince’s courage and spirit have truly become a part of him. Rhy-At feels a deeply calming, profound connection to the rhythmic pulse of the nearby sea. It is a fundamental change, a feeling of being more than you were before.

Now, rested and fortified with both a feast and an unnatural power, you prepare to make your move. The queen’s spy awaits to guide you to a secret path, a hidden entrance that leads directly into the fiery heart of your enemy’s domain—the volcano fortress of the Firewalkers.
