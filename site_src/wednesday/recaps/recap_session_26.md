Heroes of the Prophecy\! Your work in the foul warrens of the reptilian cultists had reached its bloody crescendo. Before you, the shaman Vrask led his followers in a religious frenzy, their chilling chants echoing over a dark, abyssal pit. You moved as one, silent shadows in the gloom, and unleashed a surprise attack. Arrow and arcane power silenced the guards, and Zephyrion's trident thrust silenced the shaman, ending his foul ritual. But your victory was met not with silence, but with a sickening, guttural sound of crunching bones from the darkness below.

From the chasm's edge, a horror was birthedâ€”the Maw of the Pit, a terrifying mass of flesh and bone-like legs. And as you battled this aberration, a greater terror emerged: the Gullet Sovereign, a massive, veiny tendril with a giant mouth, rose from the abyss to challenge you.

The battle that followed was a desperate struggle for survival. The Sovereign's powerful strikes battered the party, grappling both Tharok and Rhy-at, and knocking the sorcerer unconscious with a brutal blow. But in a flash of lightning and rage, Tharok unleashed the power of his axe, blasting the tendril and freeing his companion from its grasp.

With the Maw of the Pit destroyed by Rhy-at's fiery magic, Tharok performed a legendary feat. He launched himself from a ledge, axe in hand, and plunged into the pit, delivering the final, decisive blow that sent the Gullet Sovereign collapsing into a lifeless heap.

In the gory aftermath, you descended into the pit to survey the carnage and claim your spoils. Amidst the slime and shattered bones, you discovered a trove of riches, including 1,600 gold pieces, precious gems, and an ornate hammer pulsing with the power to turn wealth into destructive force.

Your grim work done, you returned to the engineers. With the parts you recovered and the monsters you slew, you averted disaster in the Great Cistern. Foreman Castro, overjoyed, promised a handsome reward from the Queen awaits you on the surface.

Now, having taken a moment to recover and feeling a surge of new power as you reach your 7th level, you stand ready. The sewers are safer, but your journey is far from over. What will you do next?
