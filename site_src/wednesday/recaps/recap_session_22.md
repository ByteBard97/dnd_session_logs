## **D\&D Session Recap: From Colossus to Cesspool – Mayhem in the Mytros Sewers\!**

Heroes of the Prophecy\! Your daring infiltration of the Colossus of Pythor culminated in a tense bargain with **Moxena, the Lady of Coins ** , leader of the **Thieves' Guild known as the "Cult of the Snake."** With an agreement struck to aid her against her sisters on Themis in exchange for her ceasing criminal operations in Mytros, you descended from the mechanical titan's leg into the stinking, malfunctioning sewers beneath the city – a realm Rhy-At knew housed the city's troubled waterworks. After a brief skirmish with an Otyugh-like horror, you pressed on into the unknown depths.

 **The Descent into Foul Waters:**

Your sewer exploration quickly became a hands-on lesson in ancient plumbing. Cautiously approaching a sluice gate, **Nicandros ** , with a clever use of Mage Hand, unleashed a torrent, gradually draining a vast chamber. Ominous claw marks on the gate hinted at unseen dangers. While **Rhy-At** considered a full "acid wash" of the massive room (a familiar chore from his temple days\!), the party opted to wait for the waters to recede.

Investigations revealed a colossal, damaged sewer pipe. The ever-vigilant **Kain** scouted ahead through another sluice, navigating a treacherous system of tiered water levels. It was here, cloaked in invisibility, that he first sensed it – a "Grick" creature, sniffing the air but failing to pinpoint the hidden ranger.

 **An Organ of Ill Omen and a Worm from the Depths:**

The dank tunnels eventually opened into a chamber dominated by a peculiar, ornate organ. **Tharok** , never shy of experimentation, sat down to play. His initial haunting notes soon gave way to a cacophony as he pressed multiple keys, unleashing a disgusting blast of "poo vapors" that even his sturdy minotaur constitution barely withstood\! Undeterred, Tharok's bizarre symphony continued, and from the echoing depths of the sewer, a gigantic, wailing, guttural roar answered his call.

The music disturbed more than just the air. In a nearby chamber, the waters began to froth and churn violently. Suddenly, a massive, slimy tentacle erupted, lashing out at the startled **Kain ** and ** Rhy-At **\! Combat was joined as the dreaded ** Plague Worm** surfaced\!

The battle was a desperate struggle in the muck and mire. **Rhy-At ** unleashed potent Mind Slivers and a scorching, empowered Fireball. ** Kain **, a blur of motion, peppered the beast with arrows, his attempt to ensnare it with a net proving futile as the worm's bulk shredded it. The goddess ** Kyra **, taking refuge on ** Zephyrion's ** broad back, offered divine encouragement while ** Andrew Lynx** pummeled the monstrosity with relentless Eldritch Blasts.

The Plague Worm fought back with terrifying ferocity, its Tentacular Tongue grappling heroes and its Putrid Bile spewing forth in a sickening wave. **Zephyrion ** , after **Nicandros** freed a comrade by blasting a tentacle apart with necrotic energy from his mace, charged into the fray. He landed mighty blows with his Kopis and the chilling Trident of Kenta-Mean, but the worm's retaliatory strike was devastating, and Zephyrion fell unconscious into the filth\!

Seeing his companion fall, **Kain ** channeled the divine power of the Radiance of Mytros sword, its holy light bringing Zephyrion back to his feet, albeit bloodied. The heroes pressed their advantage, weathering the worm's legendary resistances. Finally, grievously wounded, the Plague Worm turned to flee, slithering beneath the murky surface. But ** Kain**, enraged, gave chase. Vanishing into the shadows, he unleashed a final, perfectly aimed volley of three arrows, striking true and felling the grotesque beast\!

 **Treasures, Tortured Poultry, and Troublesome Thugs:**

In the aftermath, **Kain ** grimly beheaded the bloated corpse. Sifting through its vile innards, ** Rhy-At ** made a startling discovery: the remains of a ** Thieves' Guild ** member and an ornate chest. Within the chest lay ten flawless crystal vials – five shimmering crimson, five vibrant azure – alongside a cryptic poem. "Crimson drinks the mountain's height. Azure sips the fading light... But should you mix the red and blue, a storm of nature comes for you." With a successful Arcana check, ** Nikandros** deduced the crimson potion enlarged, while the azure shrank.

What followed was a truly... unique... scientific endeavor upon your trusty chicken, Henrietta. Administering a thimbleful of *both* potions simultaneously resulted in a chaotic, grotesque transformation. The poor bird began to wildly expand and contract, different parts growing and shrinking at random, all while squawking in what could only be described as poultry anguish. After much soul-searching and concern over its prolonged, unnatural suffering (and the noise it was making\!), and after its headless body continued to pulsate, the decision was made to end its misery, though its remains, still erratically morphing, were bagged for... reasons.

After a much-needed short rest, you continued your exploration, soon encountering a heavy, locked iron door. **Kain's** skilled hands made short work of the lock. However, as he pulled the door open, a beefy goblin appeared, promptly slammed it shut, and relocked it\! Not to be deterred, Kain picked the lock *again*, this time with the party ready for action. As the door swung inward, revealing a room with several thugs and a Yuan-ti, arrows flew\!

The ensuing fight was swift and decisive. **Nikandros ** launched Toll the Dead, ** Andrew** expertly counterspelled a *Suggestion* aimed at Tharok before unleashing a barrage of Eldritch Blasts. **Tharok ** , in a barbarian rage, charged past the frontline to engage the Yuan-ti spellcaster. **Rhy-At's ** Chromatic Orbs and ** Kain's** deadly arrows quickly dispatched the remaining foes. The hideout was secured, its alarm unrung.

Looting the fallen yielded some coin, a tarnished silver serpent ring (another nod to the Thieves' Guild), and an amulet from the goblin boss. Yet another locked door stood before you. **Kain** , proving himself the master of unlocking, opened it to a startling sight: a rather skanky-looking human woman, Lydia, and another goblin boss, mid-embrace\!

Interrupted and clearly flustered, the pair prepared for a fight. **Rhy-At ** was first to act, slicing the woman's mind with a Mind Sliver. ** Zephyrion **, leaping dramatically over his comrades, charged the goblin boss, felling him with two brutal throws of his trident. The terrified Lydia, now alone, was subjected to questioning by a sewer-stench-covered ** Kain **. She confirmed that you had indeed stumbled into a hideout of the ** Thieves' Guild (the "Cult of the Snake")**.

 **A Cliffhanger Deception:**

The session concluded on a razor's edge. Another door remained, behind which more Guild members were undoubtedly alerted. A desperate, convoluted plan was hatched: Lydia, thoroughly intimidated by **Tharok ** and the still-twitching bag containing Henrietta's remains, was coerced into approaching the door. ** Rhy-At ** even offered his skills in disguise. Lydia knocked, nervously uttered the password ("avocado\!"). A slot opened, and a suspicious voice questioned her. Her quavering response immediately raised alarms. Thinking fast, ** Tharok** boomed that they were associates of Moxena, the Lady of Coins, and had just saved Lydia from the monstrous Plague Worm, brandishing its severed head as undeniable proof\!

The Guild members on the other side, though confused by the sight of the gruesome trophy, sternly ordered you to step back from the door…

And that's where the darkness, and the session, closed\! Will your bold, perhaps reckless, deception succeed? What awaits behind that final door? And what other secrets do the Mytros sewers still hold?

We'll find out next time\!
