Heroes of the Prophecy, the battle within the Colossus of Pythor raged on, the noxious green gas swirling around you as the Minotaur Hero desperately fought. Rhy-At shielded himself with illusory duplicates while Tharok, fueled by rage and Nicandros's haste, relentlessly pressed the attack against the gas-releasing minotaur. Kain, though suffering the poison's effects, landed telling shots with his bow. Andrew Lynx's arcane blasts sought targets, while Zephyrion contended with the surprisingly resilient gladiator lady who had managed to break free from his crushing grapple, only to be struck down again by his swift reaction.

Tharok's mighty axe finally silenced the Minotaur Hero, whose dying breath cursed you for slaying their "savior." Facing the imposing minotaur alone, the remaining warrior, Kragnos, surrendered under Tharok's fierce intimidation. With the immediate threat subdued, Tharok closed the hissing valve, stopping the flow of poison, and Zephyrion quickly applied the Mithral Thread bandages purchased from Talia, miraculously purging the lingering poison from Kain's system. A quick search yielded coin, gems, and gear from the fallen foes, including a vial of noxious sludge Kragnos identified simply as "shit." Tharok allowed the defeated minotaur to depart, warning him away.

Pressing upwards, you passed through chambers filled with more strange machinery – an acidic-smelling torso room (C4) and a chest chamber (C5) housing a massive furnace heart. Here, thugs and other shady figures played cards, interrupting their game to eye your party warily. A watchful drow demanded a password, but Tharok, thinking quickly, bluffed passage by invoking Kragnos's name and mentioning a need to see "Moxina" about lucrative business, a gamble that surprisingly paid off.

Ascending finally into the head of the Colossus (C6), you found yourselves in the lair of the Lady of Coins herself. The Medusa, Moxena, lounged amidst lifelike statues – her petrified victims – under the eerie glow of a central control orb. A tense negotiation began. Confronting her about her trafficking operations for the dragon Hexia and her ties to the Isle of Themis, Moxena revealed fragmented truths about her business and her exiled Amazonian sisters. Offers and counter-offers flew: her demand for Lord Neurdagon's head, your refusal, her offer to join your voyage if you helped her against her sisters. After much deliberation and a masterful persuasion by the party, a deal was struck. Moxena would cease her criminal activities in Mytros and aid you on your journey *after* you leave the city, meeting you via her contacts near the Satyr's Tail. In return, you agreed to help her confront her usurper sisters on Themis, leaving Lord Neurdagon out of the arrangement for now. Satisfied, she permitted you to leave, requesting only that you fix the door you destroyed on your way out.

Before departing the Colossus entirely, you chose to investigate the alternate passage downward from the belly chamber – the Colossus's other leg. Descending a makeshift ladder, you entered the foul-smelling Mytros sewers. Rhy-At recalled this area housed the city's waterworks, known to be malfunctioning since Sydon's storm. Kain scouted ahead through the muck, spotting strange larval growths on the walls (which Andrew subsequently destroyed with Acid Splash) and glimpsing a large, unidentified creature moving beneath the murky water before it vanished. Moments later, a giant rat was snatched from the path by a massive tentacle-like limb erupting from the sludge. An Otyugh-like monstrosity emerged, which the party swiftly dispatched. Kain, scouting further, discovered a sewer exit leading directly to the Mytros shipyards, though not near the known berth of Varkon's *Moist Maiden*.

Having cleared the Colossus and struck a precarious bargain with the Lady of Coins, you now stand at a crossroads within the stinking depths of the Mytros sewers, facing unknown paths, potential connections to the Temple of Lutheria, and the lingering presence of monstrous inhabitants...
