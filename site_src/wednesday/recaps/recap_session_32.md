# Session 32 Recap: The Turtle and the Volcano
Date: July 30, 2025 
Heroes of the Prophecy, gather 'round and recall the path you've trod...

Your odyssey began under the cold gaze of a jealous king. As you prepared to leave Mytros, King Acastus landed his dragon upon the 

Ultros, rocking the ghost ship as he delivered a thinly veiled threat, reminding you that he would do whatever is necessary to protect his city from any troubles you might invite. But loyalty has its own rewards. Queen Vallus entrusted Rhy-At with a Mithral token holding a vision from Volkan himself. In that flash of scrying, you saw a great library carved into a cliffside, where a blue-skinned tiefling named Chondrus clutched a familiar, pulsing diamond—a fragment of Rhy-At's own mind. A single name echoed in the void, binding your quests together: 

Yonder.

With your course set, the sea itself offered an unexpected detour. An uncharted paradise appeared on the horizon—an island not on any map, for it was alive, a colossal turtle swimming through the Cerulean Gulf. This sanctuary, Jazirat Zulhaf, was a hub of strange travelers, from the disciplined warrior monks of Aresia to a blind Triton, Maelon, who guarded a mysterious, glowing shrine. A booming voice led you to the island's master of trade: Shazam, a Marid of the ocean depths. He offered a quest—bring him the eggs of fire snakes from a place of great heat, and he would reward you handsomely. A hard bargain was struck; for four pristine eggs, he would trade a 

Driftwood Wand and the legendary Disintegrating Nightwalkers.

Your journey continued, but you were not alone. Aboard the Ultros, a new life stirred. Amidst flashes of golden light, the Wyvern egg cracked open. The newborn creature, no larger than a housecat, looked past the ship's spirit and fixed its gaze upon the slender captain hiding behind the mast. In that moment, Kain, you became a father. You named him 

Bubbles.

Finally, you reached your destination: Fire Island, a land of dense jungle with a black mountain rising at its center, the smell of brimstone hanging heavy in the air. You were met by the Bloodscale tribe of Lizardfolk, whose shaman revealed their queen was expecting your arrival. But as they led you inland, your guides froze. Ahead, a rival tribe, the Firewalkers, held a Bloodscale historian captive, demanding the location of a dragon egg while two serpentine creatures wreathed in flame slithered menacingly toward her.

You did not hesitate. From the shadows, Kain, your arrows flew, turning both fire snakes to smoldering ash. Tharok, you exploded from the foliage like a bull in a china shop, your newly-repaired axe cutting down a warrior with the ease of a knife through butter. As their leader fled, Zephyrion, you teleported into his path and ended his escape with a fatal thrust of your trident.

The historian is saved, and the enemy is scattered. You now stand victorious in the sweltering jungle, with the promise of dragon eggs, the threat of warring tribes, and a genie's deal hanging over you. The heart of the volcano awaits.
