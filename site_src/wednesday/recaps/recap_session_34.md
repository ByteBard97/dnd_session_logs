# Session 34 Recap: The Serpent's Counsel

The night of the sacred feast settled over the Bloodscale village, heavy with the weight of ritual and the promise of violence to come. Before retiring, the party conceived a daring plan: to free the captive Firewalker prisoners and use them as a trojan horse to gain an audience with King Jankor. They brought this idea of a double-agent gambit before Queen Vytha, expecting to impress her with their cunning.

However, the lizardfolk queen proved to be a far more shrewd strategist. She listened intently before systematically dismantling their plan, pointing out Jankor's paranoia and the near-certainty of betrayal. Instead of adopting their plan, **she swayed them**, convincing the party that a direct, secret assault was the only path that guaranteed the Firewalkers' destruction. The party, respecting her cold logic, agreed to follow her original strategy.

During these evening discussions, Rhy-At sought out the head shaman, Sessith. The shaman shared his tribe's ancient oral traditions regarding the stars, providing Rhy-At with crucial clues to help decipher the Antikythera device. He explained how constellations like **"The Prisoner"** corresponded to their own Fire Island and how **"The Twins"** was the star-path followed by the raiders from Themis.

With their plans finalized, the party was led to a guest hut to rest. That night, their sleep was filled with potent visions.
* Kain, Tharok, and Rhy-At, who had partaken in the feast, shared a powerful dream. They stood in the heart of the volcano where the spirit of Prince Skrill rose from the magma, not as a victim, but as a being of immense power. He affirmed their bond, granting them a vision of King Jankor's weakness and imbuing them with the island's primal strength, urging them to "break the hollow king".
* Andrew Lynx and Nikandros experienced a more distant, solemn dream. They witnessed Skrill's spirit give them a respectful nod from afar before dissolving into smoke and merging with the volcano, a clear sign that while they were allies, they remained outsiders to the tribe's deepest magic.

The next morning began with the **Volcanic Protection Ritual**. Sessith the shaman prepared a foul-smelling paste of mud, oils, and rendered fat, anointing the party with the *Thek'mor Vulash* to shield them from the volcano's intense heat and poisonous fumes. As they readied to depart, Kain engaged their guide, Xatli, in a test of ranger skills. Her brilliant response established a deep professional respect between the two scouts.

Building on this newfound respect, the party made a crucial appeal. They persuaded Xatli that her duty was not just to guide them *to* the fortress, but *through* it. Arguing that her skills were essential to the mission's success—and therefore to her people's survival and her own vengeance—they convinced her to join their infiltration. Torn between her queen's direct order and her duty to ensure the mission's success, Xatli agreed to defy her instructions and accompany them all the way.

Led now by their new accomplice, the party began their infiltration. They entered the fortress through the **Secret Entrance (V4)**, a narrow and treacherous but **untrapped** path carved down the caldera wall. This route allowed them to bypass the main defenses, leading them directly into the Firewalker barracks: the **Sleeping Chambers (V6)**. There, under the cover of darkness, the party executed a brutal and effective strike, slaying the sleeping Firewalker guards in their hammocks before they could raise an alarm. A search of the chambers revealed items that told a story: a desecrated Bloodscale banner, and the diary of a young, disillusioned warrior questioning Jankor's rule.

The session ended with the party having successfully established a secure, if bloody, foothold deep within the volcano, their primary objective—the egg chambers—still lying deeper within.
