# Session 31 Recap: The Anointing of the Heroes
 **07/23/2025**

Heroes of the Prophecy! Your victory aboard the *Ultros* was absolute. With its tyrannical captain vanquished, the soul of the ship, Delphia, called for a new master. **Kain**, you stepped forward, swearing an oath upon the ancient mast, and the legendary vessel accepted you. With a will bound to your own, the *Ultros* became your instrument.

Your return to Mytros was a spectacle of impossible magic. At your command, the ghost ship dove beneath the waves, gliding through the silent depths in a shimmering bubble of air, emerging into the Cerulean Gulf in a fraction of the time a mortal ship would take. But your arrival did not go unnoticed. You were immediately summoned to the palace, where you navigated the viper's nest of the royal court with cunning. While **Rhy-At** slipped away to deliver the true story to a grateful **Queen Vallus**, the rest of you faced her husband. Before a seething **King Acastus**, you masterfully evaded his demands, leaving the covetous monarch empty-handed and furious.

Your loyalty was richly rewarded. Queen Vallus entrusted you with a sacred mission: to sail the seas and stop the titans Sydon and Lutheria before their Oath of Peace expires. To aid you, she bestowed upon you the **Antikythera**, a divine compass to navigate the treacherous waters. But your quest was clear: the device was missing a crucial gear, stolen and hidden on the **Isle of Yonder**.

With your grand purpose set, you prepared for the voyage. You sought the favor of the gods, bathing in the five sacred pools of their temple and emerging with powerful, permanent boons. After stocking up on vital potions and scrolls for the dangers to come, you made your move. You orchestrated a grand ceremony at the docks to legitimize your claim to the ghost ship. **Pythor**, the God of Battle himself, arrived to join your quest, and before the assembled thousands, he anointed you the true Heroes of the Prophecy.

Then, at the height of the ritual, as all of Mytros watched, you unleashed your masterstroke. Kain, you called, and the sea itself answered. With a sound like distant thunder, the legendary **Ultros** rose spectacularly from the harbor's depths, its black sails unfurling to greet its new masters. The crowd erupted. In that moment, your legend was forged. Gifts were showered upon you, and a hundred brave souls, inspired by your divine mandate, volunteered to join your crew.

Now, you stand upon the deck of your ghost ship, new allies at your side, the hopes of a kingdom at your back, and a loyal crew awaiting your command. The Antikythera points the way to isles of fire and scorpion, but the ultimate prize lies on the Isle of Yonder. The sea calls. Your odyssey begins now.
