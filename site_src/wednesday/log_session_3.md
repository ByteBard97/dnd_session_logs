# Session 3

***Stealth in the Shadows:***

* Under the cloak of darkness and the eerie fog emanating from the boiling geysers outside, the party stealthily navigated the treacherous grounds of the Temple of the Oracle. Every step was measured, every breath held, as the heroes moved silently through the oppressive gloom.  
  ***A Priest Falls:***  
* With unwavering precision, **Zephyrion** hurled a magical javelin, piercing the heart of **Braeca**, the formidable priest of Sydon. The fall of Braeca sent ripples of shock through the enemy ranks, marking a significant blow against the forces of darkness.  
  ***Rescue and Gratitude:***  
* Seizing the moment, the party swiftly freed the captive priests. **Proteus**, their grateful leader, expressed heartfelt thanks and rewarded each hero with a **Potion of Healing**, bolstering their strength for the challenges ahead.  
  ***The Mimic's Deception:***  
* Utilizing **Bardic Inspiration**, the party skillfully lockpicked a formidable locked door. However, **Kain**'s cautious arrow strike revealed the door's true nature—a **massive Mimic** lying in wait\! A fierce battle erupted in the stairwell as the heroes confronted the deceitful beast.  
* **Ariasia** delivered a critical sneak attack, laying the Mimic low and securing their path forward amidst the chaos.  
  ***Descent into Darkness:***  
* The heroes descended into the temple's basement, moving silently between flickering torchlights. Those without dark vision followed closely behind their sighted companions, ensuring no step gave away their presence.  
  ***A Chilling Discovery:***  
* Peering around a shadowed corner, the party witnessed a horrifying scene: **Versi**, the Oracle, was trapped, while the malevolent **Heleka** tormented a helpless temple attendant. Determined to act, the heroes fired an arrow from the darkness, striking Heleka and startling her into vulnerability.  
  ***Heleka's Wrath:***  
* Enraged, Heleka unleashed her **Fear Aura**, though it scarcely affected the resolute heroes. Desperate to regain control, she hurled piles of rotting fishbones, summoning three **Kuo-Toa Minions** to her side. A brutal battle ensued, with heavy blows exchanged and the air thick with tension.  
  ***Triumphant Victory:***  
* Despite Heleka's relentless assault, the heroes pressed on. In a climactic moment, a decisive blow landed, felling the hag. As Heleka's lifeless body crumbled, the **Water Weird** shattered, flooding the chamber and freeing the captive **Versi** from her watery prison.  
  ***Secrets Unveiled:***  
* Among Heleka's remains, the party discovered an ominous note—seemingly penned by **Sydon**, hinting at deeper conspiracies and greater threats lurking in the shadows.  
  ***Versi's Revelation:***  
* **Versi** expressed profound gratitude to the party for rescuing her and the temple acolytes from **Sydon**'s vile servants. She bestowed upon each hero the knowledge of their **Great Labors**, setting them firmly on their destined paths to fulfill the prophecy.  
  ***Escape and Peril:***  
* As the heroes made their way out of the temple, they investigated a central island adorned with plush pillows and luxurious carpets. In a sudden twist of fate, **Zephyrion** galloped onto the island, only to be ensnared by a **Rug of Smothering**\!  
* The party acted swiftly—**Kain** fired a **Flaming Arrow**, engulfing the enchanted rug in flames and freeing **Zephyrion** from near death. They extinguished the remaining ashes, reviving their brave centaur just in time.  
  ***Divine Counsel and Oaths:***  
* **Proteus** handed each hero a **Burnished Dragonlord Coin**, urging them to forsake fame in favor of their noble mission.  
* Defying Proteus's counsel, **Kyrah** passionately insisted that the heroes embrace their hard-earned fame. She proposed an **Oath of Fealty**, binding the party together to share their glory equally, ensuring that no single hero would overshadow the others. United by their oath, the heroes strengthened their bonds and solidified their commitment to the prophecy.  
  ***March to Estoria:***  
* With hearts full of purpose and spirits undeterred, the party embarked on a four-hour march through the twilight hours, making their way to the **Centrally Located City of Estoria**. As they approached the south gate, the anticipation of new challenges and adventures loomed on the horizon.
