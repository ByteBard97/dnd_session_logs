**Epic Path Reminders**

* **Kain, The Dragonslayer:**  
  Destiny calls you to become the bane of evil dragons. To forge a weapon worthy of such a task, you must speak with the **Forgekeeper in the Mithral Mines**. That journey awaits once you've dealt with the pressing threats in Estoria and reclaimed the Horn of Balmytria. Keep watch for clues that lead to the hidden Mithral Forge and the tools you'll need to face monstrous foes like Hexia.  
* **Tharok, The Cursed One:**  
  Damon, the guardian of the Necropolis, directed you to **Scorpion Island** to seek the Lotus Witch, who may hold the key to ending your curse. While that journey lies ahead, the path is dangerous and your party's immediate predicament in Estoria demands attention first. Remember that the answers you seek are out there, beyond the city's walls, once your current duties are done.  
* **Zephyrion, The Demi-god:**  
  You've met your father, Pythor, who revealed that the green dragon Hexia stole your mother away. Before you can undertake that rescue and claim your divine legacy, you must help resolve the crisis in Estoria. You've agreed to take Princess Anora's place in the sacrifice at the Rock of Estor. Surviving that deadly bargain will reaffirm your worthiness and strengthen the bond with your father, who holds the key to forging your destiny as the next God of Battle.

Log

* Persuasion, deception and reason does not seem to work on Boreas  
* Kain shoots an arrow at Boreas as he started to behave angry, combat starts  
* The whole group takes turn at smacking Boreas, Zephyrion grapples him and hugs him hard  
* Boreas calls out for help and summons 3 water elementals  
* A water elemental engulfs Kain, but he seems unphased as he can breath underwater  
* We defeat all the elementals and Boreas is knocked unconscious  
* Tharok is an innate performer and can attune to the magical Harp  
* We go back to the city and pass through the slums to get to the mountain base in order to save the city using the Harp's magical powers  
* Just before the slums, there is the Temple of Lutheria which for some reason is not affected at all by the storms effect.. Weird indeed.  
* Entering the slums we hear screams and investigate the direction it came from, we realize there is a man standing in a doorway that has turned to stone. There are 6 figures running away, Nikandros hastily webs them, preventing them from fleeing.  
* We unleash hell, maelstrom and hail of thorns upon these bandits and let one live to question him.  
* The bandits are working for someone named 'The Lady of Coins" which we understand is a medusa, and has employed these bandits to take care of specific ,musicians and get their remains and musical instruments somewhere. We have a list with the next targets and instructions which Kyrah deciphered for us.  
* It is now Wednesday of the 2nd week, 9 PM.
