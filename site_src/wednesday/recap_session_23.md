# Session 23 Recap: Of Thieves, Traps, and Tender Souls

## **05/23/2025** 

# Heroes of the Prophecy\! Your last foray into the stinking bowels of Mytros left you at the precipice of a tense standoff, the severed head of a plague worm your gruesome calling card to the wary denizens of a Thieves' Guild hideout.

# With Lydia, the flustered lover of the recently deceased goblin Klax, as your unwilling ambassador, and Tharok's booming, perhaps reckless, claim of association with the Lady of Coins, the heavy bar on the guild's door was finally drawn back. You stepped into the heart of the "Cult of the Snake's" lair – a bustling, multi-level common room and tavern teeming with the city's underbelly. Here you met its leaders: the sharp-eyed Vassilos, his scarred lieutenant Daskalos, the quick-witted Mira, the boorish Grigor the Gut, the skittish goblin Petros the Rat, and the unsettlingly calm Sister Eudoxia, a priestess of the natural world.

# While Tharok sampled Grigor's potent moonshine and Serpent's Bite liquor, Kain's keen eyes spotted a formidable guardian in an adjoining vault: Bronsidon, a massive, adamantine pill-bug automaton. Rhy-At, drawing upon his deep knowledge, recognized the masterful craftsmanship of Volkan, the God of the Forge, in the ancient sentinel. The guild members, clearly nervous when questioned about the Cult of Lutheria, admitted to "lifting" wine casks from their rivals but vehemently denied any knowledge of smuggled children, expressing genuine horror at the thought.

# The night offered a brief respite. After a much-needed bath to wash away the sewer's filth (with Zephyrion even indulging in Sister Eudoxia's rose-scented oils), the party took a long rest, with Rhy-At and Kain standing vigilant guard. Lydia, still reeling from her ordeal and now nursing a hangover, was offered Klax's (looted) amulet by Andrew Lynx in a bid to soothe her, though she remained inconsolable.

# It was now Sunday morning. Seeking the Cult of Lutheria, you received directions from Grigor to head north of the hideout, with warnings of "little reptile folk" and cobweb-laden tunnels. Grigor let you out of the hideout, which apparently had an exit leading to a ladder behind the Siren's Roost – the notorious brothel in Stygian Row.

# Navigating more treacherous sewer tunnels, Kain expertly manipulated sluice gates, at one point unleashing a torrent of pressurized storm drain water that thankfully didn't wash anyone away. Progressing north, Kain detected an invisible presence near a ladder. A potent Dispel Magic from Andrew Lynx rent the illusion, revealing a formidable Shield Guardian, its metallic hide etched with the symbols of Lutheria. This guardian, as Rhy-At and Andrew deduced from its blindsight, immunities, and regenerative capabilities, was clearly a powerful sentinel.

# An attempt by Rhy-At to bluff the construct by disguising himself and others as replacement guards was met with a cryptic demand: "Dreamers halt before the ladies' veil parts. Recite the lullaby that stoppers with minds speak or drown in violets.". Unable to decipher the password, you chose violence. Those who hid their intent well (Nicandros, Andrew, and Kain) struck first. The construct retaliated, regenerating wounds and unleashing a field of grasping Black Tentacles that ensnared most of the party. After a fierce exchange, highlighted by Rhy-At's clever use of Mind Sliver to weaken its resolve followed by a quickened barrage of Magic Missiles that shattered its concentration, Tharok's mighty greataxe finally felled the mechanical warden. Zephyrion claimed its spell-storing head, while Kain skillfully extracted its valuable breastplate, though the spell-storing plate proved too difficult to salvage.

# Ascending the ladder the Shield Guardian had protected, you found yourselves in a grim, magically silenced chamber. Behind iron bars, several children peered out from squalid cells, their silent pleas a horrifying testament to the depravity of the Cult of Lutheria. This, you realized, was the cult's hidden cellar, the destination of those "small casks" mentioned in Malachor's ledger.

# The session closed with a chilling discovery and a heavy choice: rescue the children now, potentially alerting the full force of the Lutherian cult, or delve deeper into the remaining sewer warrens to eliminate other threats first? The fate of these young souls, and your path forward, hangs precariously in the balance. What terrors, and what desperate hopes, will your next steps uncover in the shadowed depths of Mytros?
