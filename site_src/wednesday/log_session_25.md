# Session 25

* **Date:** Sunday, 2nd week, late afternoon to evening.  
* **Location:** Mytros Sewers – Engine-Works Vault (UL-6a/b), Great Cistern Complex (UR10), Upper-Right Cave Warrens (UR9, UR2, UR3, UR5, UR6, UR7, UR1).

**Return to the Engineers & The Next Task**

* The party returned the **Aetheric Capacitor** to Chief Engineer Petros "Ironhand" Galanis in the Engine-Works Vault.  
* They proceeded east towards the Grand Cistern Complex to find the second component, the Vulcan-Forged Pressure Valve.

**The Grand Cistern & a New Lead**

* Upon arriving at the Great Cistern (UR10), the party found it dangerously flooded and encountered Foreman Kastros and Engineer Thalia in a state of panic.  
* They learned that the **Chief Engineer** was missing, last seen investigating structural anomalies in a previously uncharted cave system connected to the sewers.

**Infiltration of the Cave Warrens**

* **Kain** scouted ahead and discovered a secret passage behind a recently rebuilt wall (UR9), which led into the cave warrens.  
* **Major Victory:** Kain expertly disarmed a complex trap involving a pressure plate, collapsing ceiling, and a flood of acid bile, allowing the party safe entry into the hostile territory.  
* The caves were revealed to be the lair of a savage cult of reptilian creatures (Drakonians/Kobolds) who worship a monstrous entity called the "Maw of the Pit."

**Rescue of the Chief Engineer**

* **Kain's** stealthy reconnaissance located a prison area (UR2) where several captives were being held for a sacrificial ritual.  
* **Major Victory:** Using the *Pass Without Trace* spell for concealment, the party executed a flawless surprise attack, silently eliminating the jailers before they could raise an alarm.  
* **Liberated Captives:** The party successfully rescued the captives, who were identified as:  
  1. **Engineer Talia Ironrack**, the missing Chief Engineer.  
  2. **Old Finn**, a grizzled city sewer worker.  
  3. **Snik**, a goblin captive from another tribe.  
* The party escorted the rescued individuals back to the safety of the main sewer tunnels before vowing to clear the rest of the warren.

**Cleansing the Warrens**

* The party systematically and ruthlessly cleared the outer chambers of the Drakonian cult, neutralizing threats in their communal nest (UR1), hatchery (UR3), fungal grove (UR5), and workshop (UR7).  
* Their coordinated stealth tactics allowed them to ambush and eliminate numerous groups of kobolds, including warriors and scale sorcerers.

**Loot & Discoveries**

* The party recovered several items from the cleared rooms, including a beautifully crafted music box (worth 250 gp), a Carnelian gemstone (worth 50 gp), a kobold-brewed healing potion, and several large, well-cared-for kobold eggs.

**Session End State**

* The party has successfully rescued the Chief Engineer and cleared the outlying sections of the Drakonian warrens.  
* They are aware that the heart of the cult's power—and likely a major boss encounter—lies ahead in the main sanctum (UR4), where a shaman named Vrasq was reportedly leading rituals.  
* **Next Objective:** Confront the leader of the Drakonian cult and destroy the "Maw of the Pit" to fully secure the area and complete their mission in this part of the sewers.
