# Session 33: The Bloodscale Banquet

* **Arrival at the Bloodscale Village**
    * Following the rescue of the Bloodscale historian, Citra, the party is guided to her village.
    * Along the way, Rhy-At identifies the properties of a captured obsidian dagger, discovering it is a +1 weapon that can heat up to deal fire damage and cast *Heat Metal*.

* **Village Encounters**
    * The party discovers a cage holding captured Firewalker warriors, led by a warrior named Kretz.
    * Kretz attempts to deceive the party, offering a deal with his leader, King Jankor, and providing false tactical information about the Firewalker fortress, claiming it is weak and poorly defended. The party members who can understand Draconic easily recognize that he is lying.
    * Tharok inhales fumes from a sacred cauldron and receives a divine vision of a massive serpent (the goddess Chalcia) coiled around the volcano.

* **The Feast of Bonding**
    * The party is introduced to the tribe's leader, Queen Vytha, who declares a ceremonial feast to honor them.
    * She reveals the main course will be her son, Prince Skrill, who offers himself willingly as a sacrifice to empower the heroes.
    * Initially unwilling to participate, Andrew Lynx creates a diversion by faking an attack with an *Eldritch Blast*, causing the feast to be postponed while the party pretends to chase off the imaginary assailants.

* **A Change of Heart**
    * While away from the village, Rhy-At uses his cosmology tools to discern the true nature of the ritual.
    * He learns that due to a celestial alignment, consuming the sanctified flesh will result in a permanent and powerful boon, elevating their core abilities.
    * Convinced by this new information, the party agrees to return and partake in the ritual. They successfully lie to the tribe, claiming the "attackers" were Firewalkers who fled towards the volcano.

* **The Sacrifice and the Boon**
    * The ritual proceeds. Rhy-At secretly consecrates the obsidian dagger to the Five Gods before handing it over to the head shaman.
    * The shaman uses the dagger to sacrifice Prince Skrill atop the village ziggurat.
    * At the ensuing feast, the party members make their choice:
        * **Kain** eats the flesh and feeds some to his wyvern, Bubbles.
        * **Tharok** eats the flesh and feeds some to his basilisk, Bjorn.
        * **Rhy-At** consumes his portion as a rendered oil.
        * **Andrew Lynx** and **Nikandros** refuse to eat.
        * **Zephyrion's** choice will be made upon his player's return.
    * Those who partook receive a permanent buff:
        * Kain and Tharok get a **+1 to all six ability scores**.
        * Rhy-At gets a **+1 to all six ability scores** and an **additional +1 to Wisdom** for his successful consecration of the ritual.

* **The Path Forward**
    * The shaman keeps the ceremonial obsidian dagger after the ritual.
    * The party rests for the night, gaining 10 temporary hit points.
    * They confirm their plan to take the **secret entrance** into the Firewalker fortress, guided by one of Queen Vytha's spies in the morning.
