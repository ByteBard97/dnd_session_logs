# Session 23

* **Date:** Sunday, 2nd week, morning.  
* **Location:** Mytros Sewers â€“ Thieves' Guild ("Cult of the Snake") Hideout (LL10), then northern sewer tunnels, culminating at a cellar entrance to the Temple of Lutheria.  
* **Thieves' Guild Hideout Interaction:**  
  * Successfully bluffed entry into the main common room/tavern area of the "Cult of the Snake" hideout.  
  * Met key guild members: Vassilos (leader), Daskalos (lieutenant), Mira, Grigor the Gut, Petros the Rat, and Sister Eudoxia. Lydia was also present.  
  * Kain observed Bronsidon, an adamantine pill-bug automaton, guarding the vault. Rhy-At identified it as a creation of Volkan.  
  * Learned the guild steals wine from the Cult of Lutheria but is wary of them and denied knowledge of smuggled children.  
  * Party members cleaned up after sewer exploration.  
  * Took a long rest in the hideout; Rhy-At and Kain stood watch.  
  * Morning: Andrew Lynx gave Lydia Klax's (looted) amulet in an attempt to placate her; she remained distressed.  
  * Received directions from Grigor to find the Cult of Lutheria by heading north from the hideout.  
  * Exited the hideout via a ladder Grigor showed them, leading to an alley behind the Siren's Roost.  
* **Sewer Exploration North:**  
  * Kain manipulated sluice gates to manage water levels.  
  * Kain detected an invisible presence near a ladder.  
  * Andrew Lynx cast Dispel Magic, revealing a Shield Guardian marked with Lutheria's symbols.  
  * Rhy-At and Andrew identified it as a powerful sentinel with blindsight, immunities, spell storing, and regeneration.  
* **Combat: Shield Guardian:**  
  * Party failed to provide the correct password/riddle response ("Dreamers halt before the ladies' veil parts. Recite the lullaby that stoppers with minds speak or drown in violets.").  
  * Initiated combat with a surprise attack (Nicandros, Andrew, Kain successful on stealth).  
  * Shield Guardian regenerated and cast Black Tentacles, restraining most of the party. Andrew Lynx failed a counterspell attempt.  
  * Rhy-At used Mind Sliver then quickened Magic Missiles to break the Guardian's concentration on Black Tentacles.  
  * Tharok, in a rage, dealt the final blows.  
* **Loot & Discovery:**  
  * Zephyrion claimed the Shield Guardian's head (for spell-storing).  
  * Kain successfully used Thieves' Tools to extract the Shield Guardian Breastplate (crafting component). Failed to salvage the spell-storing plate.  
  * Ascended the ladder the Guardian was protecting.  
* **Cult of Lutheria Cellar:**  
  * Discovered a magically silenced chamber with iron-barred cells.  
  * Several children were visible, imprisoned within the cells. This is believed to be the cellar of the Temple of Lutheria.  
* **Cliffhanger:** The party faces the choice of rescuing the children immediately or continuing to explore the sewers.
