* \#9 ISADORE HUORATH \- detect magic  
* \#15 The giant Tomb of Balmytria- Unlike most of the art in the Necropolis, the mosaics that line the walls and ceilings here are pristine, almost new in appearance. The panel closest to the entrance depicts five majestic dragons, one silver and four bronze, soaring through the heavens. A formidable human warrior is mounted on each dragon. The next mosaic is dominated by the verdant coast of Thylea. While the bronze dragons remain aloft, the silver dragon is shown making landfall on this new continent. Her rider greets a haggard-looking group of humans on the shore. Subsequent mosaics show human civilization on the continent blossoming from tiny towns to great walled cities under the leadership of the Dragonlords.  
* \#16 The tomb of Xandor  
* Guarding the stairwell is a bronze statue of a kneeling, bull-headed minotaur.  
* Tharok feels a strange affinity for the path up ahead
