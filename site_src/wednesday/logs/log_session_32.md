# Session 32: The Turtle and the Volcano

### **Out-of-Game & Downtime**
* The DM confirmed that Kain received ten magical arrows with various properties.
* The DM established that travel between any two islands takes three days, but this time can be reduced through specific actions like casting *control weather* or sacrificing livestock.
* Tharok successfully used the Notos Kithara (harp) with a Performance check to play a song that controlled the weather, reducing the 3-day journey to Fire Island by one day.
* The party established downtime activities for the two days of sea travel:
    * **Rhy-At** practiced his drawing, focusing on the details of the vision from Volkan's token to extract more information.
    * **Kain** spent time exploring the *Ultros* to better connect with the ship as its captain.
    * **Andrew Lynx** began practicing his charisma and persuasion skills with Rhy-At's help to better understand the people of Thylea.
    * **Tharok** arranged for Pythor to train the baby basilisk, **Baby Bjorn**, practicing its stone gaze on the god.

### **Departure & Revelations**
* As the *Ultros* left port, King Acastus landed on the ship with his dragon to deliver a final warning, reminding the party that "heroes come and go, but Mykros endures".
* Queen Vallus gave Rhy-At a Mithral token forged by Volkan that contained a scrying vision.
* The vision showed Rhy-At the Great Library on the **Isle of Yonder**, where a blue-skinned tiefling named **Chondrus** held Rhy-At's **Mind Diamond**.
* Kain spoke with the spectral navigator, **Metron**, who revealed the magically sealed chest he guards contains two things: the vengeful spirits of those murdered by Estor Arkelander, and the last egg of the dragon **Balmytria**.
* Metron explained that the egg was part of Estor's original pact with the titan Lutheria and that the chest cannot be opened without first dealing with the enraged spirits inside.

### **Turtle Island: A Mobile Sanctuary**
* While en route to Fire Island, the party discovered an uncharted island which revealed itself to be a colossal, living turtle.
* The island, called **Jazirat Zulhaf**, serves as a mobile haven for travelers and can be revisited between voyages by following its constellation.
* They encountered a group of warrior monks from the city-state of **Aresia**. The monks worship **Narcissus**, one of the Forgotten Gods, and were heading to Scorpion Island.
* The monks shared a rumor that a warlord named **Zakroth** is uniting the wild tribes of Thylea.
* The party met **Maelon**, a blind Triton guardian, who confirmed Yonder is now a fortress for the Order of Sydon and the location where the missing Antikythera gear is being kept.
* At the trading post, they met **Shazam**, a Marid (water genie), who offered them a quest: retrieve undamaged **fire snake eggs** for him.
* After a successful persuasion check, the party struck a deal: for **four pristine fire snake eggs**, Shazam will give them a **Driftwood Wand** and the **Disintegrating Nightwalkers** boots.

### **A New Companion & Arrival at Fire Island**
* On the second day of the voyage, the **Wyvern egg** hatched aboard the *Ultros*.
* The cat-sized newborn bonded with **Kain**. He named him **Bubbles**.
* The party discovered that feeding Bubbles magical **Translucent Ghost Shrimp** causes him to grow at an accelerated rate.
* The *Ultros* arrived at Fire Island, a tropical landmass with a large, active volcano at its center.
* On the beach, they were met by the **Bloodscale** tribe of Lizardfolk, who were expecting them thanks to their queen's seers and flyers.
* The shaman explained the island is home to four warring tribes and their primary enemy is the **Firewalker** tribe, who have made a pact with Sydon.
* The party was led into the jungle, where they discovered a group of Firewalkers torturing a captured Bloodscale historian, **Sithra**, for the location of a dragon egg.
* The party ambushed the Firewalkers to rescue her. Kain, hidden in the foliage, took out two **Fire Snakes** with his bow. The rest of the party engaged the warriors, killing the leader and routing the rest.
* The session ended with Sithra successfully rescued.
