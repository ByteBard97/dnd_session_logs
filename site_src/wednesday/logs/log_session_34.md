# Session 34: The Serpent's Counsel

* **A Change of Plans**
    * The party proposes a complex plan to **Queen Vytha** to use the Firewalker prisoners as double agents.
    * **Queen Vytha** rejects the plan as too risky, pointing out **King Jankor's** paranoia. She persuades the party that her original plan of a stealth infiltration is the superior tactical choice.
    * During the evening, **Rhy-At** speaks with the head shaman, **Sessith**, about the Antikythera device.
    * **Sessith** provides crucial clues, linking the constellation of **"The Prisoner"** to Fire Island and **"The Twins"** to the Isle of Themis.

* **Dreams of the Prince**
    * The party rests for the night in the honored guest hut.
    * Those who partook in the feast (**Kain**, **Tharok**, and **Rhy-At**) share a powerful dream vision of **Prince Skrill**. He affirms their new power and urges them to defeat the "hollow king," **Jankor**.
    * Those who abstained (**Andrew Lynx** and **Nikandros**) have a more distant dream, receiving a solemn nod from the prince's spirit, acknowledging them as allies but outsiders to the tribe's deepest mysteries.

* **The Morning Ritual and a New Ally**
    * **Sessith** performs the *Thek'mor Vulash* (the Fire-Shield Anointing), applying a foul-smelling paste to the party to protect them from the volcano's environmental dangers.
    * Those who accept the ritual gain immunity to environmental heat damage and advantage on saves against toxic fumes for 24 hours.
    * **Kain** engages the party's guide, **Xatli**, in a "dick measuring contest" of ranger skills, which establishes mutual respect between the two scouts.
    * The party successfully persuades **Xatli** to defy her orders and accompany them *into* the fortress, arguing her skills are vital for the mission's success and her own vengeance.

* **Infiltration of the Volcano Fortress**
    * Led by **Xatli**, the party travels to the volcano and enters the fortress via the **Secret Entrance (V4)**, a narrow and treacherous but untrapped path down the caldera wall.
    * They proceed directly to the **Sleeping Chambers (V6)**, the barracks for the Firewalker guards.
    * The party ambushes and kills the sleeping guards in their hammocks before an alarm can be raised.
    * A search of the different barracks reveals key items: **Xatli's** sister's bone necklace, a desecrated Bloodscale banner, and the diary of a disillusioned young warrior questioning **Jankor's** cause.
