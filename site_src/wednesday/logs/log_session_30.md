# Session 30 Recap: The Fall of the Ghost Captain

Picking up in the aftermath of your battle with the first mate Skaethon, you took a moment to recover and sift through the spoils of victory before confronting the remaining challenges aboard the ghost ship *Ultros*.

* **Loot and Negotiations:**  
  * You identified the magical properties of the recovered armor, **Azurescale**, and the damaged sword, **Ebony**. You also discovered four mysterious potions with potent but bizarre side effects.  
  * After a short rest, you decided to deal with the remaining two "traitorous" thanes. You first sought out **Metron, the Navigator**, in the Thanes' Quarters.  
  * You struck a deal with Metron: in exchange for his help to defeat Captain Estor, you would free the crew from their servitude within a maximum of five years and protect an ornate, magically sealed box in his quarters.  
  * You then spoke with **Davos, the Quartermaster**, on the top deck. He agreed to the same terms, contingent on getting support from the other thanes. With Metron's oath secured, Davos pledged his and the crew's support, promising to keep the spectral rowers from joining Estor in the coming fight.  
  * Between negotiations, Kain communicated with **Delphia**, the dryad spirit bound to the ship's mast. She warned, "He must be defeated thrice," before vanishing.  
* **The Battle for the *Ultros* \- Round 1:**  
  * With the thanes on your side, you prepared for the final confrontation. Zephyrion and Tharok drank powerful potions, growing to immense size, while Andrew Lynx drank a potion that shrunk him.  
  * As you approached **Estor Arkelander**, he taunted Kyra, provoking her to anger. The battle began as Estor attempted to cast a spell, which was immediately thwarted by a series of counterspells from Rhy-At and Andrew Lynx.  
  * Zephyrion and Tharok, empowered by haste and their giant forms, unleashed a devastating barrage of attacks, grievously wounding Estor.  
  * In retaliation, Estor cast *Fear* on the two behemoths, causing Tharok to drop his axe and flee in terror.  
  * Despite the fear, the party pressed the attack. A final, powerful Eldritch Blast from Andrew Lynx struck Estor, causing his form to dissolve into ashes.  
* **The Battle for the *Ultros* \- Round 2:**  
  * As you stood over Estor's remains, Delphia warned that he was not truly gone. A purple meteor suddenly streaked from the sky, crashing onto the deck and exploding in a psychic fireball.  
  * From the impact crater, a **Giant Skeleton** wreathed in psychic energy aroseâ€”Estor's second form.  
  * The battle raged anew. Kyra, enraged, unleashed a powerful lightning bolt from her wand, which was absorbed by Tharok's axe, supercharging it with electrical energy.  
  * Tharok, now recovered from his fear, landed a massive blow, discharging the stored lightning and dealing immense damage.  
  * Zephyrion followed up with a flurry of attacks, shattering the skeletal form and ending the second phase of the fight.  
* **The Battle for the *Ultros* \- Round 3:**  
  * As the skeleton crumbled, the temperature on the ship plummeted, and frost covered every surface. A blood-red moon rose rapidly in the sky, casting a beam onto the deck from which Estor's final, **Ghostly Apparition** emerged.  
  * The ghost proved to be Estor's most dangerous form. After weathering another onslaught of attacks, he vanished and successfully **possessed Tharok**.  
  * Kyra immediately identified the possession. Andrew Lynx and Zephyrion, faced with attacking their friend, focused their fire on the possessed Tharok, eventually knocking him unconscious and forcing Estor's spirit out.  
  * Now visible again, Estor was quickly overwhelmed. Zephyrion, wielding a flaming kopis, stabbed the ghost repeatedly, finally destroying the spectral captain for good.  
* **Aftermath and Next Steps:**  
  * With Estor Arkelander truly defeated, the spirit of Delphia was freed from the mast. She revived the fallen Tharok, kissing him on the cheek and breathing life back into him.  
  * The party now has control of the *Ultros*. You must decide on a new captain and what to do with the spectral crew.  
  * Your next destination was determined: you will sail for the **Isle of the Lotus Witch**, known for its giant scorpions and as a training ground for Origen warriors.
