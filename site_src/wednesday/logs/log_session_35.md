# Session 35: Into the Heart of Fire

- **The Crystal Harvest**

  - In the volcanic tunnels, the party discovered chambers lined with strange **glowing red crystals**, pulsing as if in rhythm with the mountain itself.
  - The group harvested several of these crystals, though the deeper they cut, the more the crystals seemed to resist and hum with agitation.
  - When placed inside the **Horde Maul**, the weapon grew dangerously hot and radiated shimmering waves of heat, hinting at newfound power.

- **Silent Assassinations**

  - Moving deeper into the fortress, the heroes struck with precision against Firewalker guards.
  - **Kain** felled one sentry with a single arrow before he could cry out, sending the body tumbling into the magma.
  - **Rhy-At**, posing as a Firewalker, lured another close so the party could ambush him.
  - In the fight that followed, the Horde Maul unleashed a surge of burning crystal energy, consuming its first victim in fire.

- **Unwelcome Discoveries**

  - Curious exploration led to a nest of **carrion crawlers**, which erupted from the shadows to attack.
  - The party dispatched them swiftly, with **Xatli** pinning one to the wall with her obsidian spear.
  - From the remains, **Kain** harvested paralytic venom for future use.

- **The Breathing Mountain**

  - Throughout their progress, the heroes observed unsettling signs that the volcano was alive with strange rhythms.
  - The ground in some chambers rose and fell like a living chest, and the crystals seemed to thrum in response.
  - Even the salamanders glimpsed in the distance moved in time with these pulses, suggesting a deeper connection between the creatures and the mountain.

- **Strategic Position**

  - By the sessionâ€™s end, the party had cleared multiple guard routes and secured a foothold inside the Firewalker stronghold.
  - With Xatli still guiding them and the element of surprise intact, the heroes prepared to push further into the blazing heart of the volcano.
