# Heroes of the Prophecy\!

# You stood in the horrifying, silent cellar of the Lutherian cult, the pleading eyes of caged children before you. Faced with a grim choice, you cast aside thoughts of other threats and chose the path of true heroes. Smashing the cages and gathering the terrified souls, you navigated the foul sewers one last time, emerging into the light to deliver them to the safety of Queen Vallus's palace. Her valet, Makaira, took the children into her care, promising to feed and comfort them while you provided the grim evidence of the cult's depravityâ€”the head of their magical Shield Guardian.

# With the children safe, your duty called you back to the city's underbelly. Your journey led you to the thundering heart of the sewer system: Volkan's Dynamo, a cavernous hall of shrieking metal and arcing lightning. There you met its beleaguered caretakers: the gruff dwarven chief engineer, Petros "Ironhand" Galanis, and his brilliant assistant, Elara. They revealed the catastrophic truth: the entire sewer system was on the brink of collapse, and only two unique components could save it. With the fate of Mytros's foundations on your shoulders, you accepted the quest: retrieve the Aetheric Capacitor from the northern domes and a Vulcan-Forged Pressure Valve from the flooded eastern cisterns.

# Choosing the north, you ventured into a labyrinth of Web-Clogged Domes. The air grew thick with a cloying chemical sweetness, and the passages were choked with deliberate, artistic webs that seemed to guide you toward a deeper horror. After discovering the desiccated, drained corpse of a city worker wrapped in silk, you found the entrance to the lair.

# Before you lay a vast cavern, dominated by a luminous green lagoon, pulsating egg sacs, and cocooned bodies swaying in the gloom. A chilling, melodious voice echoed from the darkness, welcoming you to her tapestry. The broodmother, Eurysphex, had found you.

# The battle that followed was a desperate, tactical brawl. After preparing with haste and blessings, Kain's flaming arrows provoked the queen from her perch high above. She retaliated with powerful magic and summoned her brood, but not before Rhy-At unleashed a devastating, empowered *Fireball* that incinerated her webbing, sending the spider queen plummeting 60 feet to the ground\! Enraged, Eurysphex unleashed her villainous power, transforming into a massive, terrifying version of herself. In a bizarre twist of fate, she then polymorphed the mighty Tharok into a tiny, furious rat\! Yet even in this form, his barbarian rage was unstoppable, and he landed a savage opportunity-attack bite on a spiderling.

# As the spider queen retreated to the ceiling once more, Andrew Lynx cleverly targeted her web anchor with precise *Eldritch Blasts*, causing her to fall a second time\! Battered and enraged, the broodmother was swarmed. After a furious exchange where Zephyrion and a now-restored Tharok endured multiple venomous bites, the mighty minotaur fought through the poison in his veins. In a brutal display of strength, he hacked off both of the queen's fangs and buried his greataxe in her head, finally silencing the chittering horror.

# In the aftermath, you recovered the Aetheric Capacitor and a trove of treasure, including a magnificent, glowing bow that can fire arrows of pure energy. You took a short rest, victorious but wounded, the first part of your quest complete.

# Now, one component is secured, but another remains. What new monstrosities lie waiting in the flooded Grand Cistern to the east, guarding the final piece needed to save Mytros from drowning in its own filth? Your journey through the depths is far from over\!
