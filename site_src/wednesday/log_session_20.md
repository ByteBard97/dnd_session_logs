# Session 20 {#session-20}

* **Date:** Friday, 2nd week, early afternoon.  
* **Location:** Mytros, heading towards the Lutheria cult's wine warehouse.  
* **Cult Public Outreach:** Encountered Lutheria cultists distributing free food and wine. Andrew and Kain publicly challenged the cult's motives and connection to Sydon's storm. This caused unrest among the citizens and led the cultists to abandon their post and supplies.  
* **Wine Barrel Clue:** Investigated the abandoned wine barrel and identified it (via Tharok's knowledge) as bearing the official seal of the Lutherian wine cartel.  
* **Wine Warehouse Arrival:** Reached the wine warehouse. Initial attempts at deception by Kain (disguised as a cultist) were unsuccessful.  
* **Information Gathering:** Overheard workmen discussing The Siren's Roost brothel and its expensive "companions" (including one claiming to be daughter of a Nereid). Kain and Nicandros used this to befriend the workmen with fake coupons, learning about their supervisor, Epimelites Malachor.  
* **Meeting with Malachor:** Spoke with Epimelites Malachor, the warehouse supervisor.  
* **Warehouse Cargo:** Learned that the warehouse transports not just wine, but also "new converts," "slaves," and "kidnapped children."  
* **The Ledger:** Gained access to and stole Malachor's ledger (Tharok, with Rhy-At's help). The ledger shows a cyclical pattern of shipments of "small casks," indicating they are frequently delivered to the main Temple of Lutheria. This reinforces the suspicion that children are being transported in these casks.  
* **Colossus of Pythor:** Decided to investigate the Colossus of Pythor. Found a heavily locked door at the base.  
* **Breaking In:** Used a combination of immense strength (Tharok and Zephyrion, now Large size with increased Strength), lockpicking attempts (Kain), and magical force (Andrew's Eldritch Blast) to break open the reinforced door.  
* **Guardian Golems:** Encountered two marble golems guarding the entrance. Discovered they can reassemble themselves after being destroyed. Attempted to delay reassembly by scattering their pieces.  
* **Lady of Coins' Minions:** Entered the Colossus and encountered several minotaurs and a gladiator lady, who identified themselves as serving the Lady of Coins (their target for Lord Taran's bounty).  
* **Combat Initiated:** Combat began after attempts at parley failed and the party used a blinding flash (Andrew) on some of the enemies.  
* **Combat Status:**  
  * Riot used a spell to restrain two minotaurs.  
  * The Minotaur Hero released green gas into the room, poisoning several party members (failed Constitution saves).  
  * Nicandros Hasted Tharok and Zephyrion.  
  * Kain, Tharok, and Andrew dealt significant damage, defeating one minotaur.  
  * Zephyrion pursued the gladiator lady who fled upstairs, grappling her and throwing her back down the stairs, dealing damage.  
  * The gladiator lady is wounded but still mobile and has escaped further up the staircase.  
  * Combat is ongoing.

The session concluded mid-fight inside the Colossus of Pythor. You have learned more about the Cult of Lutheria's operations and have engaged the forces of the Lady of Coins.
