# Session 29

* **Arrival at the Dead Falls:**
    * The party navigated a flooded passageway to reach a hidden lake where the ghost ship, the *Ultros*, was moored.
    * While scouting, Kain killed a waterlogged undead corpse floating in the passage.
    * Rhy-At explored the lakebed, discovering the remains of a previous adventurer and recovering a weather-damaged journal, 50 gp, and a silver locket.

* **Boarding the *Ultros***:
    * Upon boarding the ship, Kain touched the main mast and experienced a vision of the dryad Delphia, whose spirit is bound to the wood.
    * This act awakened the ship, causing its spectral crew and its captain, Estor Arkelander, to materialize.
    * A large, ghostly gray horned owl appeared in the rigging and was befriended by Zephyrion.

* **Encounter with Estor Arkelander:**
    * Estor revealed his immortality is the result of a pact with "The Lady of Dreams" (Lutheria).
    * He offered the party a quest: hunt down and destroy his three "traitorous" thanes. He promised that the most capable hero would inherit the ship and become its new captain.
    * The party's insight revealed this offer is a trap, and Estor likely intends to possess the "winner".

* **Combat with Skaethon, the First Mate:**
    * The party located the first thane, Skaethon, in the captain's cabin. He confirmed Estor's offer was a trap for possession.
    * Kain attacked Skaethon, initiating combat.
    * Nikandros used the **Scepter of King Driptongue** to cast *Dark Resonance*, imbuing the party with a vampiric bite attack they could use as a reaction when taking damage.
    * During the fight, Zephyrion bit the animated sword *Ebony* in half, and Tharok bit a specter to death.
    * Skaethon and his animated armor proved to be powerful foes, knocking both Zephyrion and Tharok unconscious.
    * Andrew Lynx dealt the killing blow with a series of critical *Eldritch Blasts*, destroying Skaethon.

* **Loot and Aftermath:**
    * Upon Skaethon's defeat, his animated gear became inert. The party recovered his magical armor, **Azurescale ** , and his damaged sword, **Ebony** .
    * A chest in the cabin contained 300 gp, 50 pp, a black pearl, four bloodstones, and other valuables.
    * Three unique potions were found: **Felix Felicis (Liquid Luck) ** , a **Potion of Etherealness ** , and **Sandman's Embrace** (a sleep potion).
    * Tharok's maximum HP is temporarily reduced from the specters' life drain attacks.
    * Estor Arkelander remains on the upper deck, reading a book titled **"The Ledger of Wills,"** awaiting the party's next move.
