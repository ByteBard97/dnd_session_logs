# Session 29 Recap: Blood on the Black Oak
**07/09/2025**

Your adventure continued as you finally stood before the Dead Falls. After navigating a treacherous, flooded passage, you emerged into a silent, hidden lake where the legendary ghost ship, the ***Ultros***, awaited. Upon boarding the eerily pristine vessel, Kain touched the central mast and was struck by a vision of the dryad Delphia, whose spirit was bound to the wood when her tree was felled to create it. This act awakened the ship, and you were confronted by its spectral crew and its fearsome captain, **Estor Arkelander**.

After a tense dialogue where Estor revealed his pact with the "Lady of Dreams" (Lutheria) and tasked you with hunting his three "traitorous" thanes, you proceeded to the captain's cabin. There, you met the first thane, the ghost of **Skaethon**. He warned you that Estorâ€™s offer was a trap to possess the strongest among you. Ignoring the warning, Kain initiated combat, and a brutal battle ensued in the cramped quarters.

The fight was desperate. Skaethon animated his armor and sword, locked the door to divide you, and proved a formidable foe. [cite_start]During the melee, Andrew Lynx unleashed the power of the **Scepter of King Driptongue**[cite: 1], using its **Dark Resonance** ability to infuse the party with necrotic power. This allowed you to make vampiric bite attacks, your eyes glowing black as you drained life from your enemies. Though Skaethon himself was immune to the necrotic drain, Zephyrion bit the animated sword in half, and Tharok bit a specter to death. After both Zephyrion and Tharok were knocked unconscious, Andrew Lynx dealt the final, decisive blow, destroying Skaethon with a barrage of Eldritch Blasts.

**Aftermath and Discoveries:**

With Skaethon vanquished, the remaining specters returned to their duties. In the now-quiet cabin, you found:
* **Skaethon's Legacy**: His magical suit of sea-motif armor, **Azurescale**, and his dark sword, **Ebony**, which is now damaged with a distinct bite mark in the blade.
* **Treasure**: A chest containing 300 gp, 50 pp, a black pearl, four bloodstones, an ivory siren statue, a silver dragon comb, and three powerful potions: **Felix Felicis (Liquid Luck)**, a **Potion of Etherealness**, and **Sandman's Embrace**.

**Looking Forward:**

One thane is down, but two remain. Estor Arkelander sits upon his throne on the upper deck, reading a tome titled **"The Ledger of Wills,"** awaiting the outcome of his challenge. You now have confirmation that his offer is a trap for possession. Meanwhile, Rhy-At holds a water-logged journal from a fallen adventurer, its secrets yet unread, and Zephyrion has befriended a mysterious, ghostly gray owl that watches from the rigging. You must now decide how to proceed with Estor's deadly game to claim the *Ultros*.
