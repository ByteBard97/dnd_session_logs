# Session 25 Recap: Of Rescues and Reptilians
## **06/11/2025**
 **Heroes of the Prophecy\!**

Your quest to save Mytros from drowning in its own filth brought you to the brink of disaster. In the heart of the sewer system, you found the Great Cistern (UR10) groaning under the pressure of a magical flood. There, you met the panicked Foreman Kastros and the steel-nerved Engineer Thalia, who revealed that the Chief Engineer was missing, having vanished into a dangerous, uncharted cave system to the north.

With the city's fate hanging by a thread, you chose the path of heroes. The indomitable ranger, **Kain** , forged ahead, discovering a secret entrance to the caves hidden behind a collapsed wall (UR9). With steady hands, he expertly disarmed a complex pressure-plate trap, sparing you from a deadly wash of rubble and acid bile. Beyond it, you discovered a grim, natural cavern system that was not on any city schematic: the domain of savage reptilian cultists.

Your infiltration was a masterclass in stealth. **Kain's ** reconnaissance revealed the horrifying truth: the missing engineer, ** Talia Ironrack **, was alive but held captive in a crude prison pen (UR2), awaiting a gruesome sacrificial ritual. With the aid of magic that rendered you nearly invisible to your foes, you descended upon the unsuspecting jailers. In a flash of coordinated, silent violence, you struck down the guards before they could raise an alarm, freeing not only Engineer Talia but also a grizzled worker named ** Old Finn ** and a goblin captive, ** Snik**. After escorting the grateful survivors to safety, you turned back to the darkness, your work not yet finished.

United in purpose, you became vengeful shadows, purging the foul warrens of their inhabitants. You dismantled their workshops (UR7), stormed their nests (UR6), and cleansed their profane hatcheries (UR3). The Children of the Chthonic Maw fell to your righteous fury, their screeches silenced by arrow, axe, and arcane power. Now, the outer dens are quiet, littered with the bodies of the slain. But a deeper darkness awaits. From the warrens' heart (UR4), you can hear the faint, chilling chants of their shaman, **Vrasq** , and sense a monstrous presence stirring in the abyss.

You have rescued the engineer, but the source of the corruption remains. What awaits you in the sanctum of the **Maw of the Pit** , and can you destroy the monstrous god these creatures worship before it consumes you all?
