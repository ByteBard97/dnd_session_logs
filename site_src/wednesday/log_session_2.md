# Session 2 {#session-2}

* **The Sour Vintage Tavern**: Our adventure begins in the rustic Sour Vintage Inn, where the end of the Oath of Peace looms, granting only 75 days for heroes to rise and face the darkening tides in Thylea. Each of you has been called here, drawn by whispers of destiny.  
* **A Prophetic Gathering**: Kyrah, a poet with secrets of her own, enters to greet you all—Ari, the siren rogue with charm and wit; Demetrius, the noble bard whose songs carry ancient echoes; Kain, the sea elf ranger destined to slay mighty beasts; Kyrios, the haunted medusa wizard who sees shadows in the future; Tharok, the fierce minotaur barbarian haunted by curses; and Zephyrion, the mighty centaur fighter blessed by gods. Together, you listen as Kyrah reveals your path: the Titans have unleashed a monstrous, corrupted boar—a harbinger of terror meant to cow the mortals into fear and submission.  
* **A Long Night**: As you prepare for the journey, Ari attempts a little mischief, hoping to win gold at a gambler's table—but is promptly caught, much to the chagrin of the local farmers\! The atmosphere grows tense as wounded hunters and frightened locals warn of the creature's devastation, its tusks leaving scars on the land and hearts alike.  
* **The Hunt Begins**: At dawn, you set out, led by Kyrah and joined by two hired hunters, Taneias and Javon. The morning mist and fog roll in, but despite your efforts to track the beast, the trail eludes you, and you encounter a pack of wolves. In a brief yet fierce battle, you vanquish the wolves and press on through the wilderness.  
* **The Lair of the Boar**: Finally, you discover the monstrous boar's lair, a cave echoing with the guttural sounds of the corrupted beast. Traps are set, tension builds, and the beast emerges in a fury, charging forward. The hunter Taneias is gored before your eyes, his body tossed aside, a grim reminder of the boar's terrible strength. But you fight on, giving your all in a brutal showdown until, at last, the beast falls\!  
* **An Ominous Warning**: As the creature's life fades, it speaks—a voice booming in your minds: "Your sins cannot be atoned. An ancient power sleeps in the heart of Thylea, and when it awakens, all mortal things shall fall to death and darkness." The warning lingers, leaving you chilled even as the last echo fades.  
* **A Hero's Offering**: You light a pyre for the boar, dedicating the offering to Mytros, the goddess of dawn, who blesses you with the charm of heroism. With the flames behind you, you return to the Sour Vintage Inn, where grateful locals greet you with feasting and celebration. You're the heroes of the Heartlands, lauded and toasted, their hope rekindled in these dark times.  
* **A New Mission**: As the evening winds down, Kyrah reveals a new purpose. She urges you to seek out the Oracle, Versi, whose knowledge may yet illuminate your fates and guide you against the forces of Sydon and Lutheria.  
* **The Temple of the Oracle**: After a half day's journey, you find the Oracle's temple—a forbidding chasm in the earth. Watching from the shadows, you see soldiers bearing the livery of Sydon, their presence like a shadow over Versi's sanctuary. With deftness and cunning, Ari infiltrates their ranks, deceiving the head acolyte. The ruse allows you to strike with coordinated strength, routing the soldiers who pour out to meet you, finally clearing a path forward.
