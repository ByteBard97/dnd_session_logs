# Session 26

### **Quest Log: Session of June 19, 2025**

**Objective:** Fix the malfunctioning Mytros sewer system by aiding the city engineers.

**Summary:** After rescuing Engineer Talia Ironrack, the party ventured back into the reptilian cultists' warrens to eliminate the source of the corruption. They successfully ambushed the cultists, defeated two powerful abyssal monsters, and recovered a magical hammer, completing their quest and reaching Level 7\.

**Key Events & Clues:**

* **The Shaman's Ritual:** The party discovered the cultists, led by their shaman **Vrask**, in a state of religious ecstasy, performing a ritual around a large, dark pit.  
* **The Ambush:** The party initiated a surprise attack, gaining a full round of actions against the unsuspecting cultists.  
  * Kain killed an Elite Guard, whose body fell into the pit.  
  * Zephyrion killed the shaman Vrask, ending the ritual chanting.  
  * **Clue:** The death of the guard provoked a reaction from the pit; the sounds of a giant creature eating and crunching bones echoed from below.  
* **Abyssal Monsters Emerge:** Two monstrous creatures were revealed:  
  * **The Maw of the Pit:** A fleshy, horrifying creature with bone-like legs and a circular toothy maw emerged from the side of the pit.  
  * **The Gullet Sovereign:** A massive, veiny tendril with a giant mouth and smaller surrounding tentacles rose from the abyss itself.  
* **The Battle for the Pit:**  
  * The Gullet Sovereign proved a formidable foe, grappling both Rhy-at and Tharok and knocking Rhy-at unconscious.  
  * Tharok heroically freed the unconscious Rhy-at by unleashing his axe's lightning damage on the capturing tendril.  
  * The Maw of the Pit was destroyed by a fireball from Rhy-at.  
  * Tharok delivered the killing blow to the Gullet Sovereign with a cinematic leap into the pit, destroying the creature completely.  
* **Sewer Plague:** Tharok was bitten by the Gullet Sovereign and has contracted Sewer Plague.  
  * **Clue:** Symptoms will manifest in 24 hours (1d4 days) and include exhaustion and reduced healing. The party learned that a *lesser restoration* spell can cure the disease. Tharok himself is immune to disease.  
* **Quest Complete:** The party returned to the engineers in the Great Cistern and gave them the recovered components. Foreman Castro confirmed the system was saved from catastrophic failure.  
* **Promised Reward:** Foreman Castro assured the party the Queen would reward them handsomely for their efforts.  
* **Level Up:** The party has reached **Level 7**.

**Loot Recovered:**

* **From the Pit:** After the battle, the party explored the bottom of the chasm and recovered the following treasures from the sludge and bones:  
  * 1,600 Gold Pieces.  
  * Six Hematite Spheres (gems).  
  * An Electrum Idol of a Fanged Moth (Art Object worth 750 gp).  
  * A Ceramic Amphora with Draconian Scenes (Art Object worth 350 gp).  
  * Three Potions of Greater Healing (found inside the amphora).  
  * **The Hordemall:** A magical warhammer that acts as a bag of holding for treasure (gold, gems, art objects) and can expend that wealth to create powerful magical effects, including a *wall of gold* or a *globe of invulnerability*.  
* **From the Maw of the Pit:** The party successfully harvested one jar of Mimic Glue from the creature's remains.

**Player Character Notes & Plans:**

* **Tharok:** Decided to multiclass, taking his first level in Fighter.  
* **Nikandros:** Is considering multiclassing into Bard to provide more support for the party.  
* **Zephyrion:** The party plans to use their Adamantine to craft him a functional, magical net at the Mithral Forge, as the standard version is useless.
