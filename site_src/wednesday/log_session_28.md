# Session 28 {#session-28}

*   **Final Preparations at the Mithral Forge:**
    *   The session began with the party at the Mithral Forge, discussing their newly acquired magic items. Nikandros attuned to the powerful **Robe of the Weave**, while the **Cloak of Magic Immunity** was placed in the party loot for later consideration.
    *   Kain questioned Volkan about a weapon powerful enough to slay his ultimate quarry. Volkan spoke of legendary "god-killer" weapons forged by the Gygans during the First War.
    *   **New Lead:** Volkan directed Kain to the **Isle of Yonder**, a fortress controlled by Sydon's fanatics. He mentioned a scholar there named **Chondrus**, a servant of the Lady of Dreams, who collects these rare Gygan artifacts. He warned that Chondrus is treacherous and the island is extremely dangerous.
    *   With a successful history check, Nikandros recalled seeing Chondrus in King Acastus's court.
    *   Volkan promised he could improve any Gygan weapon Kain might recover and assured the party that Queen Vallus would provide a means to navigate the Cerulean Gulf once they had secured the *Ultros*.

*   **Journey to the Sour Vintage:**
    *   The party departed the Mithral Forge via riverboat around 3 PM. The 10-hour journey brought them to the banks of the river near the Sour Vintage at 1 AM, the magical effects of their Hero's Feast having worn off.
    *   They decided to brave the 3-hour trek through the woods in the dead of night.

*   **Midnight Encounter with Goatlings:**
    *   Due to a series of poor stealth rolls, the party stumbled directly into a clearing where a dozen goatlings were performing a ritual dance around an uprooted tree.
    *   Rhy-At's attempt at a peaceful offering of cheap liquor was met with confusion and the eerie music of a shaman's pan pipes. Another shaman caused magical snakes to erupt from Rhy-At's boots, which he calmly ignored.
    *   Rhy-At successfully intimidated the goatlings into backing down. Seizing the opportunity, Nikandros then persuaded the cowed creatures to offer the party a tribute.
    *   The party received a **Goodberry Tonic** from the goatling shaman and was allowed to pass peacefully.

*   **Return to the Sour Vintage:**
    *   The heroes arrived at the tavern around 4:30 AM. The establishment had been visibly upgraded and rebranded to capitalize on its association with the "Heroes of the Prophecy."
    *   They were greeted by an awestruck stable boy, Marcus, who awkwardly offered to prepare a stall for Zephyrion.
    *   While waiting for the tavern to fully open, Zephyrion visited the town's farrier. By recounting the tale of his heroic deeds, he received a complimentary hoof trim and new horseshoes, which magically granted him increased speed and sure-footedness for 24 hours. Rhy-At, meanwhile, constructed a small, impromptu shrine to the five gods near the tavern.
    *   At 8 AM, the party entered the tavern to a hero's welcome from the patrons and the innkeeper, Aetala. Zephyrion magnanimously bought a round of drinks for the entire establishment.

*   **Gathering Rumors & Warnings:**
    *   Kain spoke with **Alexios the former smuggler**, who gave a grim warning about the Dead Falls. He spoke of a partner who vanished there years ago after seeing a ship in a hidden inlet, and mentioned that the water levels change and passages flood without warning.
    *   Following this, Kain engaged in some masterful haggling with Alexios, acquiring a magical **Goblin Mask** for the bargain price of 500 gold and four worthless gemstones.
    *   Kain then spoke with **Corax the hunter**, who provided an even more chilling account. He described a deathly silence that falls over the area at the stroke of midnight, of rock formations that look like screaming faces, and his unnerving certainty that the canyon walls themselves *breathe* and shift. He strongly advised the party not to travel there at midnight and to flee if the canyon begins to narrow.

*   **Tavern Happenings:**
    *   While information was being gathered, the rest of the party made their mark on the tavern.
    *   Zephyrion, in a grand display of confidence, had the merchant **Philomena** apply scented (and highly flammable) oils to his glistening equine physique.
    *   Nikandros played cards with **Margot**, a grieving war widow, bringing a smile to her face and drawing the jealous eye of another patron, Dorian.
    *   Kyra performed for the crowd, and Rhy-At took a moment to polish his warforged chassis with boiled olive oil.

*   **Session End:**
    *   The session concluded with the party having gathered multiple, ominous warnings about the Dead Falls. They are well-rested, well-supplied, and now face the daunting task of approaching the haunted waters where the ghost ship *Ultros* is said to lie in wait.

Of course. Here is a detailed, bullet-pointed summary of Session 29 for your quest log.
